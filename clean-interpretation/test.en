I welcome the fact that the Comission has responded positively to a lot of Parliament proposals.
We in the regional policy Committee have dealt with all the aspects here, but we're particularly keen on the need to provide greater freedom for small farmers.
And we've heard from various sources about this 10,000 Euro ceiling.
On 22. June 2012 Republic of Paraguay removed President Fernando Lugo from his office.
I think the EU is far more resolute in this issue.
If it is popularly believed and if a resolute, I think perhaps we could achieve something in the Middle East.
So I think we have to follow the line.
This was something I'm sorry to say that was rejected and the second thing in which I'm very disappointed is that we were not able to table this amendment because we didn't have any Parliamentary support.
But we are talking about very harmful products and that is why we need to have informal trialogues on the climate change package on toys. Whatever, the problem is these kinds of informal trialogues are not appropriate for a modern Parliament.
President ladies and gentlemen safety is very important.
It has to be an exception that what happens in Berlin because of fixing the profits. The S-Bahn has actually completely collapsed out.
Mr. President, first of all, I pay tribute to the excellent work done by the repartee.
Dear Claude, thank you very much.
These companies are the core of our European Union society. They're not poor relations in any way, but they are so important that we have to do right by them.
It's not a good thing if people can hear because everyone is engaging in private conversations in the aisles, and I would urge everyone to sit down and listen to speakers sunset city.
Otherwise, I'm not going to continue with the next speaker and stupid debate.
And therefore pursuant to rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addresses and will be recorded in the minutes along with the names of these significant signatories and Publishers an Annex to the minutes of this meeting.
I had actually admitted that but together with another member would like to congratulate is the Secretary-General because I was waiting for him to be here.
And that's Jesse Bozek who was President of this Parliament has his birthday today as well.
So very many happy returns.
The second declaration presented by all on accidents of trucks.
This declaration has also been signed by the majority of MEP the pursuant to rule 123rd this work.
Pursuant to Rule 123, it will be submitted to the to relevant authorities and will be published in the minutes.
So there has to be a link between structural and Rural funding.
Otherwise policies are contradictory and impossible to coordinate moving funding from one pillar to another all the time.
So we need this for proper Regional planning and to ensure the future of farmers.
So we need to make sure that Regional policies and social aid are clearly separated and that's what our Committee is aiming for.
It was about the role of the European Union and globalization.
Wild West capitalism in the financial markets which threatens whole economies including the United States. Now, of course requires International rules.
We need transparency and a restriction of rthe powers of the financial markets.
And the chairman of the Liberal group answered we heard the language of the past.
Well, at least today he's not participating.
But that wasn't the language of the past at all more than ever the future involves supervisory Powers supervision over a deregulated Market, which is never respected anything.
But I will support this carbon leakage is really a path towards Liberation and the industry that thinks it's going to have these concessions provided will need to see what the which actually provides.
The same thing applies to The Benchmark system and I think it was all.
Due respect to the Ministers and all due respect to Mrs Doyle we have to be terribly careful that in future the Comission has not simply become the almighty God of economic policy in Europe.
So I do have some doubts as I say, but I'm prepared ultimately to support the report because ladies and gentlemen, it's not only a question of CO2. It's a question of sustainability as well.
And that is something that this Parliament is not talking about enough.
We're burning up the resources that our children would otherwise be using so we need a different policy for our industrial society.
We will continue to monitor what's going on and see if any Mission limit values need to be changed.
We keep on talking about about the security interests of individual Member States.
But we have common European security interests protection of citizens within the EU and outside peace with our neighbors protection of external borders protection of critical infrastructure, and secure energy supplies secure trade routes security of our assets at global level and a number of other issues, which are common security interests of the European Union.
It's extremely important for us to continue a dialogue with Russia that we don't neglect the fact that there is still Karabakh Chechnya and Moldova.
There's Transnistria.
And in the next decade we really will have to cope with a series disputing the Ukraine the Crimea.
Hopefully we won't make the same mistake as we did when it was when we were dealing with the war in Georgia that we didn't actually assess the seriousness of these conflicts correctly.
I'm pleased to hear what you promised on climate change and I wish you all the very best for your work on that.
Given the public interest in the maintenance of biodiversity and combating climate change.
I very much hope that the Comission will follow our demand for an annual report on implementation of ETA and how it interacts with bilateral agreements as well.
Normally the rule in this Parliament is that a substance is banned if it is proved to be harmful.
This is exactly the opposite.
These products are banned.
They will only be authorized if they can be proved clearly that they're harmless.
And as for asking for more than what is being done now is impossible.
If you give the impression that something is being done, which is not going to protect the children.
I am sorry that is misleading the public in Europe.
I really wonder why you're doing that.
As has been agreed the Comission will make a statement.
There's an opportunity for you here to move Europe forward.
So I place my trust in you and wish you well.
Mumbai isn't the last time. There will be another Mumbai like other disasters.
So just be aware of that.
And also no one should underestimate the economic impact of this taxpayers money will be used in future more efficiently.
Mr. President colleagues, it is high time for us to have this proposal from the Comission.
The Women's Rights Committee has put forward very specific ideas.
We need to go beyond the Daphne Programme.
We need legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography.
It's in the interest of the users as well.
And Europol would be a potentially useful instrument to give us a network of experts and under the Aegis of which a special unit to woodworker to combat child pornography and prostitution.
The extraterritorial question also needs to be resolved.
I would like to welcome and Bernard Kushner and Jean Louis Borloo the two Ministers who have made a large contribution towards the success of this Presidency.
What I don't understand is the Barroso Comission.
So it's a huge success getting the money to people going to receive subsidies hear something which they have not put forward clearly and in good time.
Why didn't they tell us how your money's going to be spent?
Why haven't they analyzed how we meet our political goals via doing all this and the figures that you're mentioning so we could expect all this from you.
It says that the Council will not make any changes to the European Parliament's budget.
And the third Point says that there should be further better cooperation between the two institutions.
What this means for the Council is that the budgetary management of each institution will not be interfered with by the other institution.
I'm not going to comment on that agreement.
But I would like to pay tribute to the Swedish Presidency which is taking the first step to moving away from this inappropriate situation.
I think we need to make it clear that simple and clear rules.
Easier to comply with then complicated convoluted rules.
We need to make it clear that we need this Improvement in the conditions of work as soon as possible.
We need Olaf for transparency and justice in Europe.
There's going to be an area for European higher education.
And there should be wide spectrum of choices of courses high-quality courses teaching and learning for all students.
A tripartite system, the Bachelor's Master's and Post-Grad.
Today we are signing into law European Systemic Risk Board.
The oversight of the financial system within the Union will contribute to a smooth functioning of the internal Market.
The pressure has been stepped up on human rights activists and on behalf of the Parliament.
First of all in a debate about our relations with Israel where quite rightly people have mentioned human rights and humanitarian issues relating to the Palestinians.
We do have a special responsibility.
But also by the fact that the existence of the state of Israel does have a lot to do with the history of Europe and that therefore we do have a special responsibility.
Would be very restrictive other comparisons about the attractiveness of the green card in the US and and the attractiveness of what we're trying to do here in Europe?
Now is EU to use our best energy and resolution to drive negotiations forward rather than continuing to be of debating Club on the issue, which is what we have been in recent years.
We need to ensure that the national Safety authorities in adopting the ERA.
Do we have sufficient controlled for certification and their staff who are responsible for this work is properly controlled.
Or a single European certification system.
What about the license for drivers?
And we have to ensure that it's an even partnership and Partnership of equals and to achieve that you to speak honestly and openly together.
And I think that's not the case here with India that's not reflected in the resolution before us.
So we can't support the compromise.
The elections that will soon upon us to the European Parliament of one of the priorities of the inter-institutional publicity work.
The Comission supports what the Parliament is doing here through various Innovative measures in trying to raise awareness with the citizens to make sure that they know that these elections are taking place and to call on the citizens to actually make use of their right to vote.
Thank you, Mr Matsakis for that explanation.
This I remind you is press freedom in Kenya.
Gas from Russia and we are responsible in this in terms of the sort of stance.
So gas is just one part of this Commodities, trade is just one issue.
But the basic situation the stands of the EU's biggest country to the east on our continent needs to be clarified in at the same time.
We call for a national dialogue immediately with all political forces in the country. That are represented in the appropriate Comission.
As I said before we are socializing losses and that can not be right and fair.
The objective of the Treaty of Lisbon is to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the 21st century.
We have to dispel the fears of our citizens who are worried about energy, growing unemployment migration climate change.
Will have to work together just as we have succeeded in doing in the past.
We must not lose sight of the fact that the principle of solidarity is at the heart of Europe success.
This was a major crime committed by the Soviet regime and this is a reason for an appropriate commemoration of those who died.
The subject of the name between Greece and Macedonia is a bilateral matter and can not affect this process.
Quick succession into NATO of Macedonia two, very important points.
First of all, this directive will improve investment security because we have at least 20% binding targets.
National targets are spelled out in great detail with national action plans interim targets that the Comission will be keeping a very close eye on.
And that will bring enough pressure to the 27 Member States so that they can have massive investment in biomass solar water wind energy.
I know that we need diversification
Russia and with the transit countries Belarus and Ukraine, I know that there is a problematic situation.
Diversification can not mean getting involved with countries racked by crisis and with despots.
First of all the situation in the Mediterranean is changing as we speak.
The European Parliament is happy to welcome Democratic change initiated by our neighbors the citizens of that area.
Today we're going to be debating the subject of Tunisia and we'll be talking abount a partner country that's already on the road to democracy.
I've recently met with a Foreign Affairs Minister of that country and I was accompanied by five other members of the European Parliament at that meeting.
I believe as you Vice-President already pointed out we can agree that the EU has to embrace the principle of the social market.
Now this is going to be a difficult act to carry forward but because people have different political interpretations of what that means in practice.
We have overcome war and hunger.
We live in a free and open Europe in a Europe which can be proud of its cultural diversity.
Let us now prepare that Europe for the 21st century.
For our children and their children it will still hold out the promise of an economically strong socially just free and Democratic home for all Europeans.
President Vice President ladies and gentlemen colleagues, I've been in the European Parliament for five years, and I've worked on Justice and Home Affairs.
So when we talk about the next five-year program, I'm happy because we will be enjoying equal rights as a legislator and this is an issue.
If we don't have a binding agreement on the long-term objectives, then my group can't vote in favor of this.
I'm sorry about that Mr Dimas.
This is a directive we which we must see.
What makes me particularly happy is that the European Parliament has for the first time established protection of bees as a necessary Criterion.
Euros is what the annual value of this of propagation is estimated as and a third of that can be lost if the bees are not there.
There are still amendments tabled which I think should be read with though.
That compromise should not be further attacked.
What I'm also glad about is that we have achieved improvements on, you know and nEurotoxic substances.
In Europe that with these new nEuro toxic substances children's brains should be hindered.
We are saying very clearly yes to harmonization without at the same time restricting Member States rights.
Well, we've made sure that we can process these applications quickly and also the be a guarantee that the security conditions will not be abused.
With this balance between security and facilitation of Entry the Visa information system opens up to the Member States and opportunity to have immediate and direct access to all the relevant data in the context with approving a request for a Visa.
With biometric information such as fingerprints and photos.
The council does reflect the position of the European Parliament and my group will endorse that with a broad majority.
I think the approach in the white paper is worthwhile looking at the cause for badly conceived and nutrition and obesity.
Unfortunately in our food policy in Europe, whether we talk about various profiles or labeling and these are things in the white paper.
President ladies and gentlemen, CO2 is not a poison.
CO2 is not an explosive but it does have certain negative effects.
Speaking on behalf of the Bureau of Parliament.
I think of the majority of colleagues in the Chamber.
To practice a policy of zero tolerance of the kinds of actions which have led to the resignations of our colleagues.
This feed will have to ensure that the HACCP concept is a basis for the authorizations and approvals provided throughout Europe.
President Comissioner ladies and gentlemen.
For question 2 Comissioner for Verheugen is the Comission prepared to create a legal basis for the 2009 and 10 budget for this.
Would it be possible for action plans?
To get the proper supportive smes and bring forward this act given that it's particularly important because of the financial crisis.
Could we start up the program immediately for them?
Rule 123 will be forwarded to IT addresses and will also be published in the annex to the Ministers and adopted text.
Because you were kind.
Future of the European car industry will be green. Otherwise this industry won't have a future in Europe.
You can argue whether the model policy of the European manufacturers in particular. The German one was responsibility for the crisis that we have.
There were eco-friendly cars in the past fuel savers including the Smart made by Mercedes.
So it isn't a simple Construction.
Obviously speaking the model policy was wrong and the fact that the restructuring is taking place in a crisis doesn't make it easier.
But it doesn't change the fact that this restructure must take place and they must happen as swiftly.
President Comissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we want to create the best conditions for healthcare in Europe together.
In peripheral areas of the EU, mobility is an essential part of improved health care.
We also have to make sure that we respect the ethical standards in each of the Member States.
I'm talking here about genetic testing IVF and the rare diseases covered in the Trakatellis Report.
Rare diseases do need a political framework such that treatment and research can be improved companies invest in the bigger mass markets.
But the reality is different.
Boycott of some of the media arbitrary taxes penalties of 400 million Euros.
That's an arbitrary measure which brings up questions of the Government by the rule of law.
President first of all, I would like to thank the Comission of Guenther that statement being read out here today about the implementation measures.
That was something that really gave us difficulties.
It's a good thing that this statement has now been made public.
Many of the perpetrators are still at large, people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
We face one of the most important decisions of our legislative period today.
These citizens of Europe have bestowed upon us the duty to elect the best possible team for the College of Comissioners.
For the first time in history we are appointing a European Comission in our capacity as genuine Co legislator.
This requires us to cooperate in a special way with the European Comission.
Today we are to ratify a new framework agreement and will be voting at 12 o'clock on the framework agreement.
President, Comissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Lambert Van Nistelrooy said that we need to define the Fifth freedom.
And the fifth freedom is the freedom to carry out research and researchers can not be bound to Regional National or International levels.
We haven't been able to say that so far, but I think it's time to say this Parliament stands the Lisbon treaty and it would be good if we managed to bring it into Force before the European elections has not down to us.
But I think this is our position.
The question of urban mobility was initiated by Jacques Barrot former transport Comissioner that was more than two years ago at the time. It was turned into a Green Paper by the Comission. They gave us their conclusions in the Spring of 2007.
The Comission put forward an action plan on an integrated internal control framework.
Statement of assurance in the Comission's efforts to implement this action plan as you will see from our report.
The Parliament recognizes quite clearly that implementation of these means are very seriously delayed.
So the Comission has to speed up in its implementation of the plans and measures to a great degree.
If positive repercussions are to be felt and seen in the court of Auditors annual report in the near future so that we as well the MVPs can with a calm conscience actually.
To bring Ukraine to its knees and its agriculture particularly.
And they put that obviously a higher than human life and they had no mercy for the population in millions of people died a terrible death.
The Holodomor is not a natural disaster. It was planned by people and carried out by them in an ice-cold way.
It's been successfully introduced and it's Europe success story.
Then Gordon Brown was President-in-Office and Gordon Brown said very clearly at the time that the European had played a major role in the birth of the single currency.
Others also took the floor including Jacques Santer and Wilfried Maartens who said that the 11 then 15 16 Euro Zone countries were exponents of courage.
We call for a speedy resumption of Peace negotiations because we are convinced that merely military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not the right way forward.
As political actors we have a responsibility to do all that we can to make sure that the people in the Middle East can live together peacefully.
The precondition for a peace between Israel and Palestine is reconciliation amongst the Palestinian population.
The European Parliament unreservedly supports the ongoing negotiations in particular those led by Egypt which aim to set up a Palestinian Government of national consensus.
Only a Government of that type can ensure the unity of the Palestinian people.
You can't just switch things overnight whether you're in Brussels in Bali or in Poland.
We need a whole range of different measures and we want to use this opportunity to make it clear to the citizens that they too can contribute to this climate change by doing little things at home.
But we want to reach people in third countries as well and in all the different sectors concerning mobility and all that kind of thing as well and we want to bring in Industry.
So all of us are concerned and that's the good thing about it.
It's up to all of us to look at this in an in of innovative way.
Four great world leaders President of the United States George Bush Senior leader of the Soviet Union we have Gorbachev. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher and the President of France Francois mitterrand. And of course foreign Ministers of the four countries negotiating the reunification.
We must hold on to the classic full-time working system because that is the system that can guarantee our social security systems and pensions and it's financing and social contributions can be supported by mixed of types of Investments.
President Honourable Members I too would like to congratulate the Czech Presidency on assuming office.
This is the first Presidency from a country which formerly used to belong to the Warsaw Pact and just by way of extension to what Mr Nasser rightly said, I think it has strong symbolic significance.
President this package or this part of the climate package is one of the most important ones.
Because the automobile industry is really the heart of the industry in many countries.
So we have to conclude this chapter so that the car industry can concentrate on the crisis that is plaguing it and won't have to deal with the isn't targets they have to achieve.
We know that the Dayton agreement brought peace on the one hand, on the other hand it introduced the very complicated structure with all sorts of different Governments Parliament's.
There are 10 additional departments and they need 13 Ministers of Home Affairs to get an asylum law through the Government.
So the political procedures are extremely complicated and difficult.
Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, all I can do at this stage is thank you all for the broad support for this proposal from around the house.
It constitutes a compromise.
And I have to say that I myself the Comission would have been prepared to gone a step further.
However, this is what was thrashed out in the compromise and it does constitute significant Improvement.
The Austrian police found a lorry with a hundred and thirty-seven puppies, being illegally transported without the necessary documentation.
They were coming from Spain to Slovakia.
Europe of this kind of thing there are there are prohibitions in all Member States, which need to be put properly into force.
If you look at this debate on the financial disaster, you know it is simply pushing me. The climate change debate on climate change was already real was we've seen in the debate in the German Bundestag.
Nobody seems to want to know anymore what's happening and we're faced with this.
We can't go forward without learning from the mistakes of the past the EU.
There's one point that I like to draw attention to where we are actually quite firmly opposed to what we think is an error.
We don't think that we should be talking about open calls to terrorism being replaced by the word incitement to commit an act of terrorism for the quite simple reason if there is proof that incitement is taking place that proof can only be furnished once the deed has already been perpetrated.
We want to make sure that we can intervene in good time before a terrorist attack has not been committed to save lives.
President Comissioner, it is good that we at least have an agreement to take a look at the four most common offences and that we try to follow these up.
But in reality, we have to make sure that these are actually investigated and followed up. It's not just a question of a saying that that we agree that certain offenses should be monitored and followed up the key issue here.
I shall be informing you of events as they happen.
This I think will make Europe more palatable more acceptable and the electorate will turn out in greater numbers to vote then they did the last time around.
I would like to say that I thank him for his statement the European Comission.
And of course when we establish our way of achieving the 2020 strategy we have to base ourselves on the community method.
I welcome the measures contained in this package. I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament has introduced tougher registration regarding blocking systems for the role of schools.
I would agree with Mr Boesch in saying that the council must be involved in these efforts.
You've got until the 26th of May now use that time. The resolution we're going to adopt tomorrow and incorporate that into your new regulation so that you can take steps towards these small dealers.
Take the the Parliament seriously, take these small car dealers seriously.
I think we would support this kind of thing with competition Innovation programs.
We have the program for intelligent energy, we will start the seventh research program.
Trend overall is good or bad.
Do you think that it's going to become more dangerous?
And if you do think it's going to become more dangerous, what are you going to do to respond to this change this evolution of the internet Arabic?
So we've made the attractiveness of the program greater.
First of all lowering the threshold values for modal shipping from 80 to 60 million tonne-kilometres and also the thresholds for Inland shipping actions the Parliament managed to get this down from 17 to 13 million tonne-kilometres.
We've also in increased the limit for admissible infrastructure to from ten to twenty percent.
The Comission ought not to give the impression that they're looking for that Comissioner. We're on the warpath.
I know that you don't find this point acceptable, that's a shame.
What won't we try to sweep things under the Carpet the Council?
President 10 years of the Euro is a reason to celebrate indeed.
And if you'd said 10 years ago that the Euro has developed the way it has so splendidly he would have been shouted down.
I think many have contributed to the success.
There were many skeptical voices people said it was coming into life too soon.
Previous speakers listed all the names who are contributed to the Milestones of the European monetary system. There was an agreement between central banks to create key rates the Delors Report which had also all three stages of the introduction of the Euro the Maastricht treaty just two years after the fall of the wall the transitionary period.
And many people worked on this to ensure that the Euro was the success that it is today.
To impose the implementation of the strategy of how to ensure enforcement and what exceptions will allow well as regards implementation.
The Comission will regularly report to Parliament on this for all of us. This is New Territory.
So to take this step. We need the help of regular controls and confidence between the Member States that are included.
If you look at the size of the Internal Market and the Euro that certainly has given us a better opportunity to cope with a challenge.
I think that that we need to accommodate the wishes of our citizens because now what we're seeing is untrammeled profiteering arising as a result of globalization here.
Madam Comissioner dear friends Members of the Parliament.
These legal acts that constitute the Telecoms Package have been enacted in the codecision procedure.
Electronic communication and the internet have become the main tools of our modern societies.
This legislative package is a very good example of how our work can help people and can influence the everyday lives.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have to read out an announcement that on Monday the 9th of March the Foreign Affairs Committee adopted motion for resolution on the worsening humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka.
The belief that a toy or any product in Europe will become safer. If it is certified by an outside agency is not true.
For years we have results as regards safety of products.
Nothing seems to indicate that the third parties' assessment will make it any safer.
The Comission has been respecting the views of this house.
There's a clear lack of balance between the Notions of security and freedom.
It's true to say that freedom can not exist without security with the opposite is equally true.
Freedom is not something which can be bartered, it's a fundamental Universal value.
Stockholm provides further confirmation of the EU obsession with security where enormous secret databases will set up without any oversight.
This means that the whole idea we have of people's rights being oppressed will finally be coming true.
Second thing I wanted to say to my British friends across all parties.
My dear British friends. I understand Caroline. I understand your problem.
I can easily understand that the energy security of a country could suffer as a result of limit values on emissions.
I won't be perfectly willing to give Your Majesty or Her Majesty plenty of time when it comes to building new power plants.
We needed to talk about it and those talks did not take place.
Nobody wants to force city road tolls on local authorities.
But if they are deployed they should be recognizable for Citizens
For more than a hundred years we have stressed sensible approaches.
And that should be the operating principle in this area.
We've also invited the President of Israel Shimon Peres.
On the 60th Anniversary of Israel, he couldn't come unfortunately.
So what we need to do is ensure that the universities are pumping enough into this so they can and that they can get enough funding to make it possible for all students who want to to have the advantage of student mobility.
So they're going to have to come out of their Ivory Towers and get involved a bit more in business.
There are lots of big companies which would be delighted to fund a Master's course or a PhD thesis.
Mercedes Sony or whatever could sponsor a course and that would be a fantastic.
The money of course would help students who were on the course.
It wouldn't be the case that they would actually be setting down requirements for the course content. It would simply be funding which would enable all those who were interested in studying abroad to take advantage of that opportunity.
I hope that we can make some progress with the help of the Comission, and then we will all be happy.
It is not the case for all policy areas.
So they're demanding answers from us.
I just said that we want to bring in the citizens so that they do something at home and that's where local politicians industry Chambers of Commerce a tradespeople can encourage this process of motivation and achievement.
Well, I don't know if there are a major discrepancies between the groups and the Member States.
But the thing is in the debate here, no such discrepancies have emerged, for example between Poland and Germany or between Portugal and Spain or Germany and Britain Greece and Cyprus.
I think there's been a general unanimity supporting this initiative during the debate.
But there are other areas where we need other Solutions because people travel because they are on holidays or because they work elsewhere. It could be read as easy as your better care in a different country.
And so there we do need to dismantle the barriers that exist in that regard and ensure that we can create a legal certainty.
That's our second priority.
Well, the principle of effective internal control is one of the major budgetary priorities which the Comission much Supply in drawing up the budget and implementing the means effective control of budget remains is something which is checked by the ECA and the EP and has been demanded for many years many efforts have been made.
Its proposals have come from the court orders to the Comission over the years to ensure that the budget or amines are effectively applied.
Just let me remind you of what happened with irregularities in the implementation of the Leonardo program a few years ago and further areas as well, which have been opened to irregularity and possibly also fraud.
And I hope we can use this opportunity to come up with a concept which will be supported by industry and environmentalists and I commend the compromises. Thank you.
I'm sure you'll be more than aware of the tragedy in Spain in the region of Murcia. And particularly in the city of Lorca. So I would like to express solidarity with that region and with the victims.
The President of Parliament will be sending out a message of solidarity and condolences to the victims.
We have a proposal from the United Left Alliance concerning debates on breaking human rights and the rule of law.
The Madagascar debate is to be replaced by the death penalty debate. The time should be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia abu-jamal.
We want to ban trans fats. We want to properly label these on food products. And obviously there's this whole issue about waist measurement as well. And then there's a salt content in a food product. And we're demanding a some kind of intervention when it comes to recipes.
And we want some kind of promotion of healthy eating. We see that this is only possible with organic food products.
Madam President, President-in-Office Vice - President agree entirely with what you've said vice - President.
We have to draw a distinction between cooperation with countries in order to prevent piracy and where we don't actually have any ability to do anything like that for example as is the case with Somalia.
The fact that the European Union has such an image bad image among the public unfortunately has a lot to do with Olaf as well.
I can agree with the last speech speaker Olaf is neither fish nor fowl and it is characterized by an arbitrary notice in the way.
Olaf workers come to me, Mr Comissioner and they say that double measures are being used that no clear guidelines are being given.
Staff from Olaf himself has compared the practices of Olaf with the work of a secret police force, so an undemocratic institution.
There's a so-called Kelvin Report, internal Government report which sets out the practices of many members of the European Parliament, which would lead to huge numbers of Investigations. If Olaf dealt with everything the same way including an investigation of Herbert Bush has been referred to as a father of Olaf.
Mr. President Comissioner, I have every respect for you. But this is an unacceptable botch. What we have here is his incompetence.
So I appeal to the Comission and the Budgetary Control Committee to look very closely at this.
In Europe we know what the price of freedom is what the price of freedom of thought is.
On the 16th of December exactly 28 years ago, strikers were killed in the Buyuk coal mine by the Polish Communist police because they fought for solidarity. It means basic human rights for dignity.
Twenty years ago on the 16th of December in Romania, a revolution started which claimed the lives of over a thousand people because they fought for their freedom.
Well many people are threatened with the shortage of water in 2007. Third of the regions of the poeple and Union had limited water resources problems with their Water Resources. Cypress, Bulgaria, Belgium, Hungary, Malta, Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain and unfortunately many more countries that are affected.
Our water resources are being overused and this is getting worse over the past thirty years.
In 2003 about droughts 8.7 million Euros had were lost to agriculture as a result of these problems.
But it's not just a financial problem. Obviously, there's a human problem, which is greater.
The General Health of people is suffering as a result and the 35,000 people in Europe have died.
Let me remind you that means streaming in water policy the mainstreaming of water policy into all other areas of policy is of vital importance.
We can't promote projects with European money that might lead in the or in the long term to water shortages.
We have to realize that water is not an infinite Resort resource. Doyle made an important point.
But Member States have got a fairly broad framework at their disposal and we have to look at taking account of the traditions in each member state.
We always have Representatives a coming along when they're the Presidency in Office saying that the European Parliament is so important.
Then that goes it shouldn't be the case where facts are created on the ground as in the case of Swift even though we weren't an agreement in Parliament.
This won't be possible in the future.
I was given the the view that the opinion there was that the President to Parliament went to the Secretary General of the Council stating that to have you this agreement created a specific institutional framework and because of that required consent under article 300 paragraph 3 and for of the Treaty, unfortunately, it was before the 30th of May 2008.
It was to call that time before we got the reply and there was no justification given for the rejection of the Parliaments.
There is no resolution, which is before the house this evening and let's remember the significance of the agreement itself.
I would like to explain to you that it is not the President who is so kind to extend your speaking time.
President Comissioner, President-in-Office, one of the previous speakers said that we shouldn't allow violence on either side and that this is enshrined in international law.
We have to insist on the respect of territorial Integrity no veto on the internal domestic decisions taken in a country.
All this can not be done by the Member States themselves, but only by the community.
Intelligent Transport Systems based on EU-wide basic norms and minimum quantity Quality Transport create a framework for Innovations and opportunities for smes.
Of this interinstitutional agreement, but the European Council has a clear structural weakness in the form of the unanimity rule, which isn't going to get us out of the crisis.
And to have to do it like that is abusing the right of the Parliament and members of Parliament in the ability to make to adopt provisions and make legislation.
We have to look at the responses to a better and safer supply of energy. Well, Mr Barroso. You've tolerated a lot that.
Mr Oettinger a has actually allowed the things to continue that look what has been once again Allah allowed to promote not energy sources that don't have a future and going back to the old Energy Mix instead of concentrating on Renewables.
And here we're talking about tariffs to be imposed on feeding energy into the grid and here we are thinking about nuclear power stations produce generating electricity.
Thank you very much Madam President.
I think that we can judge the progress of the success most precisely by looking at what we set ourselves as a Target right at the beginning.
I remember the situation at the beginning which is something that Neelie Kroes analyzed by saying that despite a lot of liberalization packages at European level the power of the market was in the hands of fewer and fewer players in the energy area and that their power was increasing there was a growing concentration of power in the energy sector in electricity and in gas.
That's why I was very pleased that right at the beginning of the debate both the Comission and then later the European Parliament said that the most effective instrument against such concentration particularly in the field.
The European institutional mechanism calls for a white paper to follow a green paper.
And here we're talking about an action plan for urban Mobility from the European Comission.
I am considering this do you think it makes sense to have particular purposes in mind in relation to these micro credits? Would you be looking for example to boost organic production or do you believe that it doesn't apply do you think that would be a good idea or not Comissioner?
President as the reporter for the culture Committee on the new anti-discrimination directive in applying the principle of equal treatment their respective of religion belief disability age or sexual orientation, I greatly on the Comission's proposal.
That is why we are we will vote in favor of a working time directive.
So please are when it comes to the second reading be open-minded on this subject and look to work out a compromise. Because I think it would be irrational to oppose this fundamentally. So suppose minimum standards in a fundamentalist way.
I don't think that we shouldn't be looking for compromise. Should be looking for compromise in the first reading. I'll have to hand this over to the next Parliament for the next reading.
President first I'd like to congratulate to Mrs Valley but also Comissioner reding they've been very committed in negotiating roaming.
And I think that this negotiation really sets the right course ensuring that we bring National prices and roaming prices closer together. I think that's a key step forward.
So thank you President for your visit.
Mr Rasmussen has its own field of competence and it concerned about the social legislation and the necessary need to change law repealed.
I did it in the beginning in the presence of Prime Minister Topolánek.
I would like to thank you for your very engaged personal contribution.
And we want to encourage you to continue as you just have said so that the check Presidency will be successful in it s second half as it was in the first half.
So good luck for the continuation of your work.
A few days ago in Rome. There was a major conference at which the banking industry was at the top of the agenda and on Thursday. I saw in the papers Morgan Stanley had been expressing their optimism.
On Friday the newspaper said: he is seeking protection.
If you look at Merril Lynch Bear Stearns, Banks like that Lehman Brothers which have run into a total disaster, it is obviously urgent that we now have to do something.
Let's be clear the car industry must take take a new Direction smaller more frugal cars not which is better not just for the environment and the climate but also for the long-term securing of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Firstly because the resolution says that this catastrophe in this crime only related to Ukraine and people of Ukrainian nationality.
And I said right at the beginning of this that does not correspond to historical fact.
Thank you very much Madam, President Madam Comissioner, Laszlo Surlan said that this budget is pretty small one percent of GDP available for this.
So we need to manage our money carefully and we need to manage it particularly carefully because of the crisis and the way it's impacting upon people.
I'm grateful to Mr Barrot that you've put quite clearly here that you'd like to get together our Swedish colleagues and understand where the problem actually lies.
And we need to give a very clear vote of thanks to the French Presidency.
So pass it on-it's all the institutions. Thank you.
The practice of course can be a little bit different and some members of the European Parliament know that.
Mr Guardens Campo I've seen Mrs Erika Mann and others have asked for the floor.
They'll be able to tell us a few things what they've experienced in Mumbai last December.
Even though three Member States don't have an Embassy in Mumbai and seven don't have a consultate representation in New Delhi.
Thank you very much, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
I can tell you that for some time I have been observing these developments very closely.
We require total transparency because the people who attack us call upon us to show transparency. They can not have have double standards.
The patent compromise is not an example.
We believe we should do everything we can to emerge from the crisis quickly in the interest of our citizens.
So for instance lard to deviations of Demands for information and actual information given and in a response. From the Comission statistics on intra Community trade.
I'd like to ask the Comission when the results of this study will be submitted.
Now, if you look at the title of my report or rather the report from the Agriculture Committee, which was adopted unanimously. It's a situation and Outlook Hill and in Mountain farming and we have to recognize that this is only part of what is actually contained in the substance of the report.
But now of course for us the question is what will we do with Member States who have been with us since 1981.
I would like to ask the Comission unless it's one of the lessons that I draw from this the more consequent. The Comissioner is the better the results.
I would like to have that consistency for the Comission's area.
I would expect the Comission to show a good example and to show that it can be done and how it can be done in the report.
We would ask for support particularly for Bulgaria and Romania in building the justice system and financial control.
We want not to be in the same position into your time are today.
And that's a very important point for us.
It's essential that we work with our colleagues in National Parliaments that we gauge in dialogue with them. Now these are the kind of rights that we have agreed on.
One thing is clear to all of us if somebody is illegally employed because he or she can not live in their own country.
He can't go along to the police say look I'm being exploited or woman who's been raped because they know they can be expelled.
I hope that will mean that the statistical burden in the medium-sized companies because we will be able to target the specific data that we need for our statistics.
And I hope that the vote will proceed swiftly tomorrow.
Mr. President, about Turkey's Democratic steps forward in its recent referendum should be put in context.
It's still can't cooperate with the EU on the return of refugees.
Turkey is very often not a country of origin but a country of transit the needs to be some kind of cooperation.
Frontex can not end up meaning that the EU has to pay for Turkeys Frontier protection.
We can't be the milking cow.
Therefore has to sign as to hold to the Geneva Convention on refugees and I can not refuse to take refugees back.
Mr. President-Mr Vice President of the Comission, because of the limited time available to me, I'd just like to pick up points in relation to Roure report.
Talking about the processing of personal data and the framework of police and judicial cooperation criminal matters, I'd like to say that I'm very clearly off the view that we need a standardized European rules in recent years.
Now what we fear is that we 're going to see Cuts in 2013.
The figures which have just been cited by the Comission. Well, you could see that the mountain labored and brought forth a mouse.
Now, this is a very lukewarm proposal.
But the therapy which is being proposed here is pretty laughable.
It's quite interesting that in the credit crunch Russia is rescuing a number of states in order to try to weather the storm of the credit crunch itself.
This intermeshing is even greater than it is perhaps in the energy sector.
25 years ago almost to the day President Ronald Reagan addressed this Parliament on the 8th of May 1985.
This was the last and so far the only time that US President has spoken to the democratically elected representatives of the people of Europe.
Your presence in this chamber today Mr Vice President is a symbol of the renewal of that dialogue at the highest level between our two continents here is in Europe.
President Comissioner ladies and gentlemen, the convention offers a recognition of the Dignity of people with disabilities and their right to a full involvement in society.
So it's even more important therefore that before the International Day for people with disabilities the Council approves this document and submit that approval to the UN officially.
President Comissioner for Hagen distinguished colleagues firstly, let me thank the shadow reporters for their constructive cooperation during the legislative work.
Also my thanks to the French Presidency for having being able to come to compromise for this legislative work and the Presidency has contributed greatly to that.
First of June 2008 was the start of pre-registration and finished on the first of December 2008 so six months.
Then in adopting the regulation what we agreed was that we would be dealing with about 200,000 substances that would be pre-registered.
Looking at the pre-registration requests coming in at the last few weeks before the final deadline was reached was over 1 million.
We are entering into a phase where there's a serious risk of recession.
We need to make sure that we can cover the risks of this small people in Europe that ordinary citizens if we're coming up with plans here, we need to think of our ordinary citizens the workers of Europe.
We need to give them as much protection as we give to their big front the big fish the banks.
We have further chance to make it very clear indeed that this is about patients rights, and we're not going to be clouded by national perspectives.
There are two points are going to have to tackle firstly.
The question is specifications of product.
We monitor adaptation to technical changes.
I'm actually a member of one of these the Fed European broadcasting institution.
Freedom of movement is one of the greatest successes and achievements of the European Union.
But I think in countries where we have lower standards, we it will make it possible for them to understand that they how to increase their standards.
Freedom of movement shouldn't make it possible for the achievements.
What you can't have is Europe achieving social rights for workers and then undermining them doing away with them.
This is a policy which will never be pushed through in the European Union for doing the same work.
So we have to ask urgently that they stopped making the Parliament look ridiculous and the Council to stop make itself look ridiculous in turn.
It's also important to give the public common rights in this European union.
That's why I would call upon you to pursue this to ensure that the class actions should be introduced because that would be a very important signal for the public in Europe.
In dealing Production Policy you can't say that there's just good or bad food the outset that quite clearly it isn't.
It's a question of having balanced or unbalanced diet.
And the reasons for bad nutrition are multiple.
We've got to try and have a guide consumers with labeling bidding of advertising differing tax. You mentioned that but different tax rates, but that's not going to help us.
But we've had serious disasters.
My colleagues have also referred to more recent disasters.
We have a commitment to act on behalf of people and the environment. We have to ensure that the flag States shoulder the responsibilities.
We have a representative who will be using at least 60 percent of its energy deriving from coal.
And so in this area, we need to see further developments in technology so that India South Africa Australia and the US and Russia will be able to use these technologies.
It's an opportunity for Europe to carry out some investment and to develop these Technologies in a positive way to deal with CO2 emissions.
My dear colleagues, the Council of Ministers of Justice and the interior at a meeting last Thursday after a brief debate reached agreement on a procedure for what they call the Schengen evaluation mechanism.
This new mechanism has triggered an outbreak of sharp criticism from almost all groups in this house.
I was one of the few people who had an opportunity to say something about it.
This is apparently a one-sided or a unilateral change in the legal basis from Article 70 of the treaty on Article 70 of the EU treaty.
Parliament plays a less prominent role in the procedure.
So the Conference of Presidents has asked the Danish Presidency in Office of Counsel to attend a debate tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
We support that idea politicians need to assume their responsibilities and take up the opportunities offered to them. Only a stable Bosnia and Herzegovina can enter the EU.
Whoever undermines that will not help the situation.
So I would call on all people that hold mandates in that region to assume their responsibilities and to focus on the welfare of their citizens.
President 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed equality of women in the labor market hasn't seen much progress.
It's true to say and there are alarming figures 80 percent of part-time workers are women.
And women have an employment rate of only 57 percent as compared to 72 percent of men.
Wage an equality has made no progress since 2003.
These are alarming figures that we all lament here.
It's been stated that women penalized twice because you've got a pay gap leading to lower pension entitlements and different levels of social standards.
Security and tax and the social system continuously penalized women because for example unmarried couples and double earners in many tax systems.
Germany suffer a disadvantage.
I find it unfortunate that the EVP-ED has moved away from the compromise just before it was concluded and has come up with a whole raft of amendments to all the points of the report.
There will be no solution via terrorism or via conventional weaponry.
We feel that extremists will now be able to exploit the situation where openings have been created through what we have voted through.
And clearly the question problems arising for industry in the further use of REACH.
And following the analysis, of pre-registrations, we will very closely look at this.
But we can't tell what the huge figure means.
We do need some time there.
And my proposal would be that here or in the Committee. I would come back to you and tell you the results of the analysis and say exactly what the next stages are going to look like.
President ladies and gentlemen fighting climate change and the New Order of the world economy will only be tackled if we have a common approach.
We needed a new green deal.
It's been it's taken years to implement the form of their police force and so for me Bosnia and Herzegovina must show a will to cooperate beyond the borders which have existed so far and they must introduce reforms at all levels after the reform of the police force.
And I'd like to ask you now to deliver your message to the European Parliament.
You're very welcome President Mahmoud Abbas in the European Parliament.
It's often been said already that the possibility for the consumer to work either in the language of where he's living or in his own mother tongue.
This also leads a further step to driving bogus contract bad contractile out of the market and once again, it puts the whole business on a more serious footing and people who want to buy a holiday timeshare.
Be able to do so with full confidence.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the pharmaceutical package, which I'm submitting to European Parliament this evening, in a sense Guided by a light Motif.
That is taking account of the needs of patients in our health system.
We have submitted a paper which I feel has brought about considerable improvements in the Comission document.
What's important above all is to have moderation and healthy attitude towards eating.
Slimming is just as harmful to health as having an unhealthy attitude towards food as a whole.
Individual energy needs are often dependent on many different factors health age and so on.
We don't need new legislation.
We celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, dating back to the 10th of December 1948, a decision by the United Nations General Assembly.
Declaration was a global commitment to defend human dignity and equality of all people regardless of the color of their skin their religious belief or their origin.
Article 3 of The Declaration states that everyone has a right to life freedom and security.
I would like to point out that the Czech Presidency didn't let me do more than its reputation. But it was differentiated.
There was excellent officials, excellent Minister such as Schwarzenberg, Sasavondra and others and Prime Minister Fisher did some excellent work.
I would like to say that country has one problem. And that is President Klaus who has seriously damaged his country where he consciously torpedoed the success of the Presidency.
I'd like to thank Premier Fischer for having remained in charge having gone to the Brussels Summit himself and having successfully concluded the Presidency.
We're facing major challenges and we need to make sure that we do not forget the interests of developing countries.
It is also with sadness.
They need for many of these countries are the Free Trade Agreement.
Maybe that's the way things really are maybe in the stage of development many of them have reached they have to develop their own economy as European countries did by closing the market off a little.
President Colleagues Comissioner one fears to speak given the general impression in Plenary one fears to ask questions.
Everyone's against discrimination and one doubts the ability to put questions.
In this process under the treaties Parliament in international trade agreements does not have major political nature ergative except for what is contained on in Article 300 subsection 3 & 4.
Having a specific institutional framework is the usual way in which this pans out in practical terms.
And it provides the basis for the use of assent when it comes to international trading agreements between the EU and the ACP countries or with Korea with Indian with southeast Asia as well, which is of course important in combating deforestation now, why is the sense of important for us.
Mediterranean bread is also healthy, and I'm happy to see that fruit and milk in moderation and also wine.
It's been scientifically proven and this is a result of the British medical journal from September 2008 that the Mediterranean diet has a contribution to reducing cardiovascular conditions and Diabetes Type 2.
It combats cancer Alzheimer's Parkinson's as well can be the those conditions can be mitigated. My father comes from threats go there. You'll see many old people which is a sign of survival and a big part of that is the diet.
We need to look at the economic structures and how they can prove be preserved.
It's not going to be possible to wait for the results just to sit by and do nothing.
And that's why the Declaration that we will be adopting is a step in the right direction. It won't of course of the problem of crime, but it will step up checks.
We also need to look at the risks involved, who owns these factories and so on and we're all of these substances come from and what kind of murky channels they were coming through.
We need to step up our checks and make sure we get to the bottom of this.
President President-in-Office of Council, it's a particular pleasure. It is final rounds that we have found such an amount of balanced interest.
I thank everyone who spoke everyone who put their inputs in.
We have developed a roadmap to Copenhagen and this roadmap has got two traffic lights has got road signs.
And in the spirit of compromise wish. Mr Demetriou, actually, by the way, thank you for helping us. We hope we'll be able to convince. Mr Casini.
That in effect what we've got here is a positive position on the basis of amendment number 38. Where again we make it quite clear, although it's already in the text Provisions proper that you only use law which is a member state law and which meets the basic constitutional legal Provisions.
I wouldn't have thought any Court in European Union would allow any any law Corpus of law to be implemented which didn't meet our basic principles.
President Colleagues, we have a clear job to do set out by the ecj to provide a system for patients are traveling abroad for their care and for the reimbursement of that.
It was worth reading the Frankfurter report.
He gave a good very good account of the constellations there and you can see the interplay between official and unofficial troops. So just saying you want to deploy more Monarch troops is not sensible interjection from the President its amount of get the with the origins menu.
President I want to speak again because some colleagues are looking at something rather contradictory. They've referred to the problem of employment.
Madam President Madam Comissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to know what the Customs quota for the European fermentation industry. How is that being in secured by the GD trade?
This is important because for the competitiveness of the fermentation industry.
The Erica Prestige and other accidents involving shipping should not be seen again with Port State Control.
But I think it's a pity that we excluded large parts of the scientific Corpus of knowledge available.
There are people who have more positive visions and they weren't listen to their amendments.
The amendments which were resolved were turned down science is what fits in with political people's political views.
We should be requesting permanent again.
So we are opposed to the postponement.
Mr. Mitchell, regards your point of order, I'd like to tell you something which might be a secret about debates in the Bureau of a part of the last Bureau meeting.
The situation that you have just described sadly doesn't just happen in Strasbourg.
In Brussels too we've had some weeks where it was quite impossible to get around the things move through the Labyrinth which our buildings are because lifts weren't working.
The basic condition is that somebody has to talk to Hamas. Those who are prepared to talk to Hamas need support.
If the settlement building continues and I've heard about another 163 hectares set aside for settlements.
Before I give the floor to Mr Chastel, I would like to read an extract of a letter that's been sent to the members from the children of Sakineh, which I got from Amnesty International regarding the debate on the world day against the death death penalty, and I'd like to read it extract.
Dear colleagues let me introduce in few words, our signing of the financial supervisory package.
This package will constitute the financial supervisory activities, which was adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.
President colleagues, this is a very necessary debate of principles, but let's not forget the terrorism list.
We know that as of the third of September ruling of the European court of justice which was totally clear.
The terror list system as applied in the EU and the UN does infringe citizens rights.
But regardless of that the Comission will on a daily basis continue to make sure that the citizens can enjoy their civic rights every single day.
In a number of areas where your report, Mrs Gacek, you are calling on the Comission to act the Comission is already acting to guarantee that these rights are being consolidated and extended.
The Comission's action plan on Consular protection is one that I'd like to mention.
And maybe I can say that I share wholeheartedly your view that this is one area where something has to happen.
Just a few weeks ago, in fact, we had a very interesting debate in this very chamber. Then we can see when it comes to Consular rights.
Getting organized fighting organized crime and illegal immigration is an important European concern.
But we have to say that since the 11th of September 2001 there has been the constant reduction and infringement of the Civil Rights.
When I was a young boy and entered politics, I was told that one should never talk to terrorists.
Couple of years later, I saw pictures on the Telly that this terrorists actually won the Nobel Prize for Peace.
So what was possible then could also be possible in the future.
So the question is all the mechanisms that are available to us enough to create a dialogue.
And I would like to thank people in my group and also in the other groups who work together to support that resolution.
I think that's a very good signal to send out in terms of improving the atmosphere and if we manage to achieve that then we have made a small contribution to try and put a stop to this death which none of us can accept.
I'd like to add however, it's not about watering down the environmental targets for the car industry.
We insist on the environmental targets being met. However, we must give some attention to the troubles of the car industry and we'd like to debate the matter with a member of the Comission.
We'd like therefore broad support for this proposal.
The clear vote in the Committee and the trialogue that was very successful has shown that we're making a good fist of this.
I like to just focus on two important points of this legislative proposal.
We've managed to ensure that Eurostat through this regulation will have unlimited unrestricted free access to all statistical data, which is necessary to deal with Statistics referring to National economies.
That will contribute to bringing about more transparency in national statistics and will help the Eurozone a little along the path of moving towards better competitiveness.
And I think given the financial crisis and difficult discussions we've had on the European statistical system is good news.
So in Colombo and in Jaffna, we see that war is an institution that is constantly being confirmed.
We're seeing thousands of people who don't have adequate nutrition and don't have medical care here.
If we could only get a ceasefire that would allow help to be given to the civilian population.
Because what we could do is have it made it easier for the civilian populations to be evacuated through corridors from the war zone.
But we've seen that hasn't been respecting a ceasefire and is misusing people as a human shield.
I understood that the Socialist caused the crisis in Europe.
Well, we knew that already that's always been well-known in Germany.
The Sun Shines always caused by the CDU though the SPD is responsible for the snow and ice.
What you've announced, Mr Lehna and where you attack me personally. Now I may have made a mistake.
Mr. President, first of all, congratulations to Françoise Grossetête.
And also thank you to the Comissioner for what he said particularly about counterfeit products.
We are drafting an email for all members, which will then be translated in all to all the appropriate languages and we'll give you all the technical details you could want.
Clearly we all have to speak the truth.
That is our obligation all of us at all times in this department.
Before giving the floor to Krishna Deli that may be on everybody's behalf, welcome the members of a delegation of the Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia who've taken their seats in the official Gallery up there.
President ladies and gentlemen, this debate by coincidence is taking place at exactly the right point in time.
My report is concerned, however, with the other side of the coin.
Europe without barrier is a good slogan goes right to the heart of European values bringing people together.
But I hope that we can bring down the barriers in some people's heads, who have ideological blocks about the European Union and that's blocking further development of the EU as foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty and indeed in your country that's quite a bit of work to do on that.
There is alo a lot of work to be done in your hand.
So for your information, I'm just preparing an email which I will assign in person and it will be addressed to all.
All of you who have not made it, everyone will have that information.
The email will be sent to you around 11.
I am very glad to welcome to Parliament. Mr Roland Dumas.
We are very glad to see you.
The blue card and this uniform system governing residents and work will create what we need. So that the Member States will be in a position to respond when necessary where they need highly qualified people. Some Member States might not need so many it's really a matter of demand for that labor equally.
We will be creating a situation in which we've got uniform rules for the issuing of such blue cards.
I'm glad that in its implementing Provisions, the Council has taken onboard my proposal namely that the blue card should have some kind of mark or stamp telling you which country issued the blue card.
In Austria for example, they have red white red blue cards, and in other countries. It is similar.
I'd like to know is there is there an initiative in ecofin and by Comissioner kovacs to have Energy Products like the Nabucco pipeline or Renewable Power plants that we can have a progressive tax write down throughout Europe or on the other hand that they could be financial incentives, so that these strategic initiatives could be taken forward.
Have taking the initiative here in July this year I put a question to the Council on the state of play that proceedings had reached.
The council informed me that at the time it's saw no need for an initiative unlike Parliament.
Given that former French Comissioner is now Minister and has highlighted the need for adaptation. I really can't understand counsels position.
Mr Galeote E. I can only hope that the content shown for the Parliament's decision will be lifted.
I would like to thank Mr Galeote for taking the initiative.
I would urge the French Presidency to take urgent action on behalf of European citizens.
And do you have a very ambitious reform program and you have a reliable partner in the European Parliament.
But this Parliament will fight to ensure that the financial resources of the EU needs in order to live up to its Financial commitments to countries such as Haiti that we need to guarantee these financial resources, which is why fighting for an ambitious European budget is a way of guaranteeing that we can keep our promises of solidarity.
So welcome the Comission's approach for a horizontal directive against discrimination.
I am very pleased that this debate is happening.
Only by looking consistently at such Crimes of the past can that we can overcome the past.
The opening up of archives is a first important step in the right direction.
This relates not only to Ukraine but also to all other countries that lived under the Soviet communist yoke and of course it is that includes Russia itself.
We have been facing a difficult time in particular. The financial crisis and it's drastic knock-on effect on the world economy.
President, ladies and gentlemen, debates of this kind are all always very very difficult for all concerned.
It's difficult because Israel is a friend of ours. A lot of us is applied to me as well. A lot of us feel intrinsically linked with this country in a spirit of friendship.
This area is attracting increased interest, but we need to look at the needs of the populations there because people and nature should not be mutually incompatible concepts here.
So if we're talking about energy policy we can point to considerable successes.
Another significant problem needs to be addressed. We have equated things that need to be viewed differently.
We've also been able to reduce noise emissions through this regulation.
Now that involves some costs. That's true.
That's why we've been able to include a passage to the effect that this the cost of this reduction was not be borne entirely by owners and by Tyre manufacturers, but by others as well.
And I'm very grateful to Council.
Thank you very much President and particularly, thank you to President-in-Office Borloo.
You are trying to combat unemployment and poverty in the next few months and years.
And therefore this sensible package has conditions.
We don't have to do 100 percent for Industries with high carbon leakage. What we need is a hundred percent allocation.
Because we need the non carbon leakage Industries. We can start with 20 / 20 and 20% increase will allow us to do that.
President Comissioner colleagues climate changes, everyone's objective.
There are different ways to achieve that and then approaches are not necessarily recognizable.
I have nothing against Green procurement where that makes sense.
I reject this directive.
It's not going to change the result in Parliament.
Dear, Mr Secretary-General distinguished guests.
Your colleagues members of European Parliament dear friends great honor for us of were coming to the European Parliament for his first official visit his Excellency Secretary-general of the United Nations Doctor Ban Ki-moon.
You can't really talk about speeding ahead.
Let's think about Enron and Parmalat.
There was a report that came out our colleague Katiforis and I myself was reporter when it came to the rating agencies. There was a report in 2003 on that subject.

I'd like to take this opportunity to turn to the Slovene colleagues for whom I have great deal of sympathy. I would appeal to them to try and find a path. So that all the great achievements of Slovenia will be able to continue for the unification of Europe.
It's the first new country to introduce the Euro and to introduce Schengen first.
Slovenia is a pioneer of European integration and I hope that Slovenia will continue to be a Pioneer to allow Croatia to join as well.
We think that Costa Rica and you President Arias will play a crucial role in ensuring that these negotiations reach a successful conclusion.
The significance of milk production has been talked about particularly in mountainous areas and we need to look at jobs as well as the landscape because both are equally important.
Preparing a soft landing for the era that ensues after 2015 is a very important aspect as far as I'm concerned.
I'm opposed to a general increase in the milk quarters because I think that that's problematic and given that that's the case.
I believe that when we've got high milk surplus, we need to be cautious.
We also need to realize that the farmer only gets thirty percent of the sales price of milk. But the sales price in my member state is really lower than it has been over the last 25 years even as things stand now.
Madam President, and the crisis and meat crisis has spread throughout Europe. It means that Irish meat has been as old as that Tyrolean bacon.
The only solution for this EU eye problem is to have it have a declaration for fresh meat stating the place of origin and if it comes from a third country.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what a shame that Mrs Harms has left.
It was an unusual attack, which was bordering on insulting. In the circumstances, it would have been nice to have an opportunity to respond to her.
I shall do that in writing.
The Comission rejects everything that Mrs Harms said both in terms of style and substance on the issue itself.
We have citizens in Europe who can think for themselves.
A traffic light based labeling system is not representative because it only can show certain individual factors. They just confuse consumers.
Which should you choose if you can only see red, green and yellow.
This sort of thing would further raise prices.
I would like to draw your attention to a test statistic that the medicines European medicines agency has made available when it comes to what can be achieved through better patient information.
In Great Britain 5% of all people who admitted to hospital. Find themselves in hospitals because they were given the wrong drugs.
Given five percent of all Hospital admissions in the UK are the result of wrong medication.
And we know that in fifty percent of all cases that could have been avoided if patients had been informed about the the nature of the medicinal product that they were prescribed.
And I use that argument vis -à- vis the health authorities in the Member States who are not over enthusiastic when it comes to enhance patient information because they feel that informed patients are more demanding and therefore will want more expensive drugs.
First of all, belief in so-called intelligent technology this can easily mean that and people shirk their responsibilities and pass it on to machines.
But they can only be worked out by the actors on the ground because they know what is needed.
We draw up a report which drew attention to very serious problems of corruption involving large sums of money.

We are concerned about the recent events in China where 12 people were sentenced to death following the unrest and ethnic violence in Urumchi XinJiang Province in China.
Though serious criminal Acts were committed in July's unrest we call on the Chinese authorities to respect the requirement for appear for a fair and transparent trial.
We are equally concerned about the sentencing and application of the death penalty in the United States.
In particular in Ohio State where several executions by Lethal Injections where postponed after repeated failed attempts.

We have awarded the Sacharov Prize to Memorial and we believe that we will contribute to eradicate fear violence and other forms of persecution that are affecting the Defenders of Human Rights.
Discussion we have had with vice-President Wallström.
We know the Comission is trying to give us as Fuller answers as we would like, but then it obviously curtails the number of members who can participate.
Thank you all and I'm sure you will get full answers in writing.
For whom health is of course the most important thing they have a right to the best and safest therapies and medications.
President Comissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India Summit is a new step to deepen the relationship between the European Union and India.
We want to promote India's economic development.

Japan was hidden by a triple disaster.
First of all huge earthquake nine on the Richter Scale struck Japan.
And then a tidal wave 20 meter high waves along a huge stretch of coast.
And then one of the the first of three reactor blocks of Fukushima Daiichi blew up.
It is perhaps the worst nuclear disaster after Chernobyl.
So the document were voting on today is environment-friendly and as part of the CO2 package. It can help to make a very important contribution to Europe's policy to reduce CO2 emissions from Automotive vehicles.
But at the same time it contributes to Consumers drivers being able to play less to pay less. I'm sorry while still being environment friendly and will hopefully reduce the consumption of petrol and Diesel.
This is an important for this Parliament to see how we can improve the safety situation and the roads of Europe not just with trucks but also with private cars.
December 2009, the President is here by addressing the relevant Committees of the Parliament requesting them to verify the legal basis and the procedural changes which are proposed by the European Comission as well as any other changes and amendments that would need to be introduced in the context of the European of the Lisbon treaty. Their positions went to verify whether they wish to adhere to the existing positions already which could constitute the their decision in the first reading.
Mr President Comissioner dear female colleagues and male colleague.
I would like to say how pleased I am that the Comissioner is taking this subject on borders will and not only in the brief statement he makes now but also within the Comission because we need to ensure that the European Comission takes up our ideas and puts them into practice.
And where's Mrs Kroes?
She's not thinking about about whether Ireland is actually able to afford to have two hundred percent of its GDP to bail out its depositors and in and she's not such even said a word about that.
We need to support civil society and we have to support the efforts of those who are fighting for the rights of those who have been detained.

The preparations for the first reading of the budget have involved 1400 amendments all of these had to be read analyze and understood and they were had to be seen in the against the background of the economic crisis.

Your message today, Mr President was very important for all of us, but it was very important as well for the future always see Summit in Astana Kazakhstan in one week 1st and 2nd December.
And first of all, it was of crucial importance to whole your region to calculus South Caucasus, we have always known that you are brave men. Now we can also say that you are also prudent men and courage and Prudence should always go together.
I voted in favor of this report quite simply because we need to take all kinds of measures be they police and judicial measures. And we need cross-border measures to properly structure are exchange of data.
It's important that there be uniform standards across Europe.
However the Comission will lay continue to pay particular attention by the dissemination of information on the implementation of the directive. There will be information passed onto citizens. There will be information put on the website along these lines.
And we will make sure that the Member States will carry out awareness-raising campaigns amongst the citizens and will support them.

Patient information is certainly one search and Medicine safety is another one.
Patients are entitled to have proper information about their sickness and if they are properly informed.
And if they can deal on equal terms with people producing medicines, then they should be able to get safe medicine and safe medical methods.
In our work, we have noted that our children live in a very complex world that world.
The future of a child living here and now is uncertain. A child might stay within its own cultural circles or finding a new one.
It might follow the example of its parents or exactly strike totally the opposite path.
It might marry somebody of the opposite sex of its own sex.
We couldn't have expected when we founded the EU.
If they have been scientifically proven to be safe the lowest limit values worldwide for toxic substances, like lead or mercury.
It's our job to make sure that Vietnam becomes an equal partner and opens up and get comes closer to us.
But not at the expense of fundamental and human rights, but on the basis of an equal and equal partnership based on human rights.
That is also a way of reducing risks, which is after all our ultimate goal.
We also have basic principles of integrated plant management. That is something that will apply to the entire European Union as of 2014 and it will be binding.
We're also looking at the water framework directive and making sure that that has a priority.
We also have these buffer zones in our Member States making sure that we can protect our soils that we can also make sure that we have measures which are tailor-made to the environmental circumstances that we have.
Now there are Provisions concerning equipment checking that equipment making sure that we have regular inspections. Risk management also means making sure the professional users are properly trained and trained on a consistent basis in order to make sure that they handle these substances.
Private users who don't necessarily have that kind of training are informed properly because they could cause damage and when it comes to the purchasing of these products, they need to be informed of the proper use of these substances.
We are taking a decision on a compromise concerning Goods which limited in their trade to a few Member States for me.
This has been highly interesting experience of pure Advocates of the internal market and free competition suddenly lapsed into National protectionism and wanted to exploit all those tools but unsuccessfully and thankfully.
Intercultural dialogue shouldn't end in December 2008. Intercultural dialogue should continue beyond that.
We have measures which are good here for the environment for our consumers and for users as well.
We will have similar requirements throughout the whole of the European Union. That means that we have good safety standards and good production standards as well as poor substances active substances, which are harmful, they can not be authorized. I think we agree in saying that.
But if we have a ban we need to make sure that that ban is informed that it is based on scientific evidence.
Also we need to bear in mind that with pesticides, you know, like with many other things in life. It all depends on the dosage.
But if you increase the dosage, it might be an actual threat to life.
The basic principles of the fruit peace process doesn't engage in violence and conducts peace negotiations with Israel.

We need to ensure that there is no abuse of the data contained in the database.
It's a basic right at the end of the day of every US citizen that their privacy should be respected Freedom means freedom from the state not a freedom guaranteed through the state.
But I think things have to be sorted out in such a way that both countries particularly after the welcome meeting of that the two prime ministers attempting to get a common peaceful solution rather than allowing the radicals free rein.
I do agree with that that free-range should not be given to the radical stupor on new poison.
This is particularly for Mr. Slota's radicalism, but also for the Hungarians Guard as well.
I would like to see efforts by both sides and all parties here as well as the Prime Minister to stop the radicals.
The GUE/NGL group rejects this resolution most EU States.
The group insists that the regulations for Kosovo should be in line with international law and that applies to Serbia.
Other people like South Ossetia and Abkhazia are going to want to follow.
Madam President, Mr Kindermann actually talked about the cormorants problem and came up with an excellent resolution, which I was more than happy to vote in favor off.
I'm glad that 558 votes were cast in favor.
The cormorant was protected and there were only a few hatching colonies.
But since those days whole rivers and ponds have been empty. have had all the fish hoovered up out of them by the cormorants and the damage caused by these birds actually jeopardizes the existence of young fisherman. So it's true that we have to preserve natural diversity in species forever.
If the Comission faild to act fish species are threatened. Their continued existence will be put at risk.
There are three major demonstration projects in the world namely oil production and gas production.
But I think we've got to give primacy to this project. We always advocate technology, but we've also got to consider the whole issue what happens with these storage facilities further down the line.
It is rule 140 of the rules of procedure According to which the agenda can be changed.
I'm very sorry that I can't have many points of order at this stage.
Yes, you will get the floor but I really have to say that I will withdraw the floor from anyone if you join that debate.
I intended to write a report that was intro sent interesting for all decision-makers as a representation of the development over the next 30 to 40 Years of the system and also recommendations for actions.
Social Security and pensions are very different in our Member States. That's how they have grown up. And that's how they've been financed and EU harmonization is therefore not feasible.
I think you've demonstrated an ability to act with certain cases recent you but also a sensitivity to people in Europe both in terms of the working time directive but also the internal organization of the European Parliament.
Well, of course, it's not easy to find the right form of words, but where there are flaws these need need to be detected by the Ombudsman, but we need make sure that we serve our citizens
And Mr Diamandouras I think you've made a very good contribution in that regard over the last year.
President, I'd like to thank Carlos Coelho and I'd like to congratulate him on the report.
We could hardly wished for a more quality report as we used to from him.
Carlos Coelho you pointed out from the very beginning that in this report. It's about the security of children.
And we can achieve that by having more secure passports via fingerprints. We can see if this is actually the person who is presenting the passport and who is crossing the border.
It's a matter of sending this ship of War of discharge to the Council.
European Parliament has to act freely according to the motto that everything which doesn't actually appear in the auditing doesn't exist.
The objective is to reduce bureaucracy for cross-border bus and Coach Lines.
The revised 12-day rule for occasional International coach transport is good news for passengers and companies alike.
The EU should be more attractive for Labour immigrants.
Asylum policy should go hand-in-hand with development policy.
Strictly monitored external borders, especially in the Mediterranean thousands of people are dying as they seek refuge from poverty Wars and natural disasters.
Yet expensive, external border monitoring programs and methods to try to prevent immigration is for something that requires a new more decent approach to immigrants. And we also need to really look at the causes of this Exodus.
Madam President ladies and gentlemen allow me first react to what Mrs Corbey said, that we we took the initial move to create a European database on prescription drugs.
The work is proceeding well on that database and it will be available in the foreseeable future.
I was at the Gaza border over the last few days and I've met people on both sides of that border.
I don't think a truce is sufficient.

I therefore believe that the Conference of Presidents decision is the right one in my book.
There's no reason why banks won't it shouldn't be able to cope with the code situation, but the smaller ones were also given greater confidence.
I want to really point a finger at one of the very shameful stories of the Pension funds in this house.
Vice President Biden has been the key figure in American politics and French two colleagues in this chamber for many years.
He was first elected to the US Senate in 1972 serving as the one of the youngest Senators in his country's history.
He was re-elected six times before becoming Vice President of United States in November 2008.
Further nationalists or separatist trends which is used by officials to defend their own jobs and which is harmful to the people.
Israel of course has a right to defend itself against those who want to destroy the country.
However a demoncratic country under the rule of law has to think about whether means that they're using is proportionate.
I think and I think most people in this House go along with me in saying that these means are not proportionate.
Service-providing companies are there for those people who want to use these services and they're not for the operators?
I think it's important for us to look at the users of modes of Transport. Whatever that mode may be making sure that we have the rules in place in order to ensure that people who demand these services are given good quality service.
With that in mind it's important to remember and I'm picking up on a point made already.
We are making an effort here in order to help those people who have reduced mobility.
As far as I'm concerned, not just a person who has a disability card is disabled necessarily.
Parents with small children, they need assistance and they should be provided that assistance for all our modes of Transport.
I hope that one day that too will come true.
But nonetheless we 're not talking about being sympathetic or non-sympathetic.
We're talking about solutions.
We need to start talks with these people and colleagues have said that today repeatedly.
And also we need to make sure that people in Gaza are able to live a reasonable life.
Why do they vote for Hamas?
Because they see this as the last possible opportunity for their survival.
We need to give these people economic hope, let's lift this boycott lift the isolation.
On Monday, we had this in the debate.
I even get the impression that we ought to be handing out party cards for the Socialist Party to the PPE-DE group.
They can't change their opinions fast enough.
Able to participate that was followed up in March 2007 by a decision that all partner countries as would essentially be able to participate in certain Community programmes.
Because you can learn from experiences like that.
The Comission is convinced that we can do a lot to make sure that citizens of the European Union can enjoy their rights under Article 20 of the EC treaty.
Citizens expect that they have an added value in terms of protection in third countries.
Protection from diplomatic and Consular representations shouldn't be restricted to crisis situations, but it should be also cover help in everyday situations.
This is a modern Progressive package.
I hope that it will have the support of the European Parliament.
So my proposal would be there were more activities when it comes to cutting tax and promotion here.
I think we could achieve a great deal.
So I would suggest that we start a new initiative.
I would urge the EVP to withdraw the amendment where they would like to delete certain parts of the proposal.
President Comission, we thought this crisis for told and people didn't take it seriously.
Oh, well, it was just going to be these some gas guzzlers in America that suffered.

Water poverty has been made worse by many of the decisions taken in countries like Cyprus where they decide to build our layout golf courses despite the shortages of water and the problems that causes.
I'd like to thank everyone that contributed to the debates to messages.
This isn't just the case for consumers themselves, but also for small and medium Enterprises and Traders.
Now in the future, Mr Comissioner, It might be worthwhile looking at the idea of merging these directives because many smes face the same problems in the internal Market as consumers.
We have seen a lot of examples for example some advertising and misleading business practices.
We all know the this address book fraud all over Europe.
President colleagues, as a journalist, I'd like to point out one shift within this legislation which really bothers me.
10 of 27 Member States have not properly implemented this directive now, we're trying to superimpose a change directive.
I'm bothered especially as a journalist by the likely repercussions in terms of press freedom in Our Member States that could take a hit on press freedom.
We need to constrain those who potentially might be anti-semitic or Neo Nazis.
There's another aspect as well in property where Neo-Nazis attempt to buy up property.
They then have property that could be let out or resold, we can not do anything about that whether we sit on the right or the left.
That's the sort of thing which I can not be in favor of. I'm in favor of a referral back to Committee, if that's not going to go through then I will be voting against it.
I like to limit myself to the aspects of pertaining to social policy the prosperity of the so-called industrialized society and consumption.
The amount of consumption of fossil fuels are the main reasons why we're seeing harmful greenhouse gas emissions taking place.
However, the socially weakest and poorest to the ones who suffer the most from the looming climate catastrophe.
They don't have resources to be able to adjust and adapt.
Food prices and fuel prices being on the increase affect their more.
Famine situation is worsening day by day.
Petitioners point out that the European Union rather is trying to do things and then can't actually come up with the goods.
There's no computer program that we can buy so that we have the possibility of people watching the broadcasts of the European Parliament with a single format open Parliament means open standard.
So I think we have an obligation to meet and I think we need to take action.
Now you all know Mr Lambrinidis not just as a very efficient leader of voting here in this house.
But you also know that he is lawyer with a great deal of knowledge and expertise and I think he has winning personality and therefore is the right man for the job.
And so I'd like to thank you for your applause and your support and I am sure that Mr. Lambrinidis can therefore count on the support of this house.
Madam President, the initiative taken by the Czech President see to water down EU Child Care Facility targets is not acceptable and we are really ashamed and naturally reject them.
Some people have asked to take the floor people from the Council and other people have made some comments with regard to the future negotiating mandate and information submitted to the Parliament.
That is so decided and will be so in the record of proceedings.
But can we Comissioner agree that if that the Council doesn't have a clear objective for income from the Eurovignettes, then the proposal will be withdrawn.
You're saying you don't need any new tax.
If you're going to have the Eurovignette then you have to use that money to cut environmental pollution and problems for traffic rather than to going to The Minister's pocket.
So I hope you're going to stick with that.
No tax if the proposal isn't tied to a specific line, it should be withdrawn.
That accession have been a great success.
You have to be careful to ensure that the national supervisory authorities are really independent.
President, six months lie ahead with drama declarations and protestations.
I hope there will be a constructive Presidency because we have massive tasks ahead of us.
The war between Israel and Hamas the economic crisis you've spoken about those and also internal issues such as the Lisbon treaty.
Certainly there is a risk of zero wait.
Mr Lehne still has the difficulty of having to work out future procedure.
So let me propose the following the was an agreement at the first reading between the reporter and the Council.
The Council on the 2nd of December wrote a letter to Mr Lehne saying that it it was unanimous in coreper to agree on the text that we wanted to agree on here.
For this text most of my group voted against.
I'll explain why by citing a couple of examples from my home town France.
We are seeing left radicals and the Neo-Nazis trying to muscle in on the property deals.
Dear colleagues ladies and gentlemen, let me say on your behalf. Welcome to the European Parliament all the honorable guests.
We remember many of us, some of us very young.

We listened with great attention to Mr Radwan.
The Bavarian election campaign is making itself felt.
Yes I think you're right with some of your comments.
But the taxpayer of the U.S.
It's also essential for us to look towards opening the Balkans.
You attached a great deal of importance to enlargement of the EU towards the Balkans.
There are plenty of problems still to be solved in that region of the world.
I think that we can solve many of these problems once we open to the Balkans and countries accede to the European union.
And with all the problems that we are now confronting this was not a natural disaster some sort of Tsunami.
Someone was responsible.
Somebody didn't pay attention and want to do something.
The Nobel Prize winner actually made a whole series of points.
Mr. President, obviously how much people can earn determines how attractive Europe is in terms of being a research location.
What's Commissioner Kovács thinking about tax free income for researchers and what about tax-free donations to research institutions or can they be written off against tax?
They do this in America.
Couldn't the Comission carry out a study to think about what incentives we can give?
You quoted my friend Joseph Doyle who said that the financial crisis wasn't all about a defeat of capitalism.
It's not a defeat of capitalism because capitalism be continually unfortunately.
But it is a defeat of capitalists who for years said, we don't need any rules and regulations the market can regulate itself it can take care of all the problems itself.
Those are the ones that have been dealt a blow those have been defeated.
And those that have said, we don't need rules and regulations.
If you can explain here today that we need a Europe of rules and Europe of regulations. If you can go along with that then I could agree we need more rules to focus on the financial crisis.
Welcome to this club of European Regulators who I think you've seen the light.
We need a different calculation basis for the corridors.
We've suggested one per country.
I think in Germany, we need a north-south and East-West Corridor.
Secondly, I have to see if alternative corridors are possible.
It must be clear that the overall capacity of the rail network isn't lessened where many citizens are concerned.
Now, what we are looking at is trying to strike a balance but having a dual strategy with criticism and entering into a partnership seems to be the way ahead.
There's a risk that it'll become a routine and people don't take us seriously.
We won't be taken seriously in the results that we present.
The Court of Auditors report is an interesting report name and shame is the name of the day.
I'm also glad that animal protection has now been put into the regulation and that we have achieved more transparency.
Although I would still have liked to see more courage coming from the Comission side.
With this increased access to the application protocols through electronic means we have I hope achieved something.
And my last sentence is not just a milestone for the environment and for consumer protection.
It is a stellar moment for Europe because we have for the first time managed and for the first time in the world managed to protect ourselves from these dangerous substances in this way.
The last phase the agency has set up a hotline to try and help out with problems.
Let me once again repeat. This is a very important decision.
We realize that we do need a resolution as quickly as possible nevertheless.
We also need a resolution which will have very strong support and these are the issues that are at stake right now.
The Soviet Union saw as its supreme goal the preservation of the status quo, but now Russia wants to change the status quo.

President I would welcome the Krahmer Report on the prevention network.
There is a good framework with some flexibility guaranteeing a Level Playing Field.
And therefore it is absolutely critical that with all possible peaceful measures and potentially military means using peacekeeping troops.
I mean, we're not there yet. We need to discuss that but we need to consider.
President, I'm grateful to the Presidency and to the Comission for the very clear statements they've made on the situation.
President, well, I can support this resolution because it reflects my very specific proposal for combating the black economy and non declared work.
Mr Watson and myself President Pöttering and Brian Crowley were participants in the castle in Prague where there was a meeting.
We have to look more closely at what we should be doing.
And for example, a consumer scoreboard is a very important instrument which should be further resorted to so that we can see what the needs of the consumers.
What is Europe doing?
Well, I think Europe has been far too weak to implement these things.
I'd like to see Council and Comission being much more robust and decisive to ensure diversification.
For Europe because of course for energy suppliers, very important.
This question of energy properties so important and what are we going to do about that which is a grave problem.
President ladies and gentlemen colleagues, well, we're faced with a very dramatic situation as we're all aware.
It's completely irresponsible what Russia and the Ukraine are doing.
I think that we have to be honest and say that well, we have to say that the Comission really reacted very late.
But it's also true that in an excellent way Comissioner Piebalgs has dealt with this question over the last few days.
An expert group, it's a fantastic idea.
Thank him for most recent steps taken.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. I'm grateful for the broad support for the European space policy that this debate has displayed.
And I would also like to express the wish that this broad support be effective when it comes to providing the financial foundations for a permanent sustainable European presence in space.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors aren't asleep here.
Other regions in the world already much further even in terms of vision.
If we are not able to come up with new projects. And to develop new technologies, then we will lose leading position in the use of space based applications because the scientific and research of bases will be lacking.
Health is one of our most important things, perhaps the most important things.
And this is going to become all the more in an aging Society.
In a Democratic Society that patients can be fully informed about issues pertaining to their health including medications.
We will forward these.
The French Presidency did apologize in due time.
Today we'll be discussing Kosovo on the basis of a very thorough report by a colleague, Mr Joost Lagendijk who is a reporter and this will be linked by declarations to Comission and Council and statement by Council.
When the results were announced I was at the other end of Europe in Sicily.
There the applause was at least as loud as today in this chamber.

The Irish people have sent a clear message that they want to stay at the heart of the United Europe.
I would like to thank colleagues the shadow rapporteur for the constructive work.

For all involved it comes down to political will and professional tea and the will to make compromises.

In particular the refusal of Council to appoint independent authorities with all powers for the inspection of ships is unacceptable because it will simply lead to a situation where accidents are still possible.
President in the Green Group in the European Parliament, we're wondering how it can be the case that we're talking about a resolution about a long-gone program.
Yesterday the Swedish Presidency came up with a very much changed draft of the stockholm programme.
I think that the vast majority of this house been able to read this draft.
I think for this very sensitive topic. That's wholly unacceptable.
At first reading of the proposal the Comission will be able to act on energy efficient policies and take further steps when it comes to Energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions.
Madam President this compromise which will be voted on tomorrow on the emissions trading system has the signature of the European Parliament.
The reporter has done or all she could on the subject.
This compromise was also characterized by a sense of consensus and this means that the program can be activated quickly.
So we need a 'Marco Polo three Proposal' from the Comission.
We'd have a general debate to clear up all these points which are necessary for our future direction, and we need to know how these adaptations are, what sort of effect they're having.
Comissioner who was going to be the Observer?
PPresident Comissioner dear colleagues before I come to my report, I would just like to say once again that I think that our decision on the debate of initiative reports is not correct.
After observing these debates with no dialogue no real discussion no controversy without conflicts, then I don't really think this is a entry debate at all.
And I hope that after the elections we will change this procedure nevertheless.
I said something earlier about the grey area implicit forms of advertising.
We're familiar with such forms of advertising and we're seeing this kind of advertising creeping in.
Thank you for personal commitment and integrity. It is something that we can all be enthusiastic about in this house.
So congratulations.
President President of the Court of Auditors Vice President of the Commission ladies and gentlemen.
It is indeed true that it's something of a tradition in the European Parliament for us to point out that the relationship between European expenditure and National Administration means no declaration of assurance can actually be issued.
I remember the previous present the Court of Auditors Professor Friedmann said that it's not actually possible to issue these statements.
So this means that all of us have to get our heads together, so as to find ways of ensuring this can be done.
Should we really be using taxpayers money to create this kind of competition?
No, we should change subsidy law.
So that money is not paid for relocation and neither is it paid through the Member States?
The Bureau of the European Parliament will meet at 6.30 pm.
We shall look step-by-step at the various ways in which we can make sure that members journeys home can be made easy as possible.
Tomorrow you shall receive information by email.
If new information is received I shall inform you on Wednesday morning.
You shall receive information tomorrow morning by email and supplementary information may be made available to you on Wednesday mornings.
As soon as information comes from the city of Strasbourg authorities, we shall pass that information to you.
The situation is under control and we shall do everything to enable you to return home.
I would just remind you that you'll be receiving further information tomorrow morning and Wednesday morning.
This success is a collective success.
It's a collective success of those that we can't see, all the people who've been working in the back room jobs.
It's a success for this Parliament. I would very much like to thank Fiona Hall, Britta Thomson, Umberto Guidoni, Werner Langen, Anders Wijkman for the confidence and the trust they put in my leadership.
I particularly like to thank one person Jean-Louis Borloo.
Without his personal input and the work of his Cabinet and the work of the French Presidency.
We perhaps might not have been able to hold Mr Berlusconi down the other weekend and make sure that this directive came through.
So it's a collective success and that this sort of thing we need to be able to do in Europe.
If we were to judge this as the Greens judge everything they want to kill the cow that is giving the milk and others want to milk it without feeding it at all.
Voices aloud saying that European companies shouldn't be belong just to the Chinese Europe sold out a long time ago with cross-border-leasing and similar things to that.
President Comissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
We are ensuring that in the future Schengen visas being granted of three months will be issued according to unified and harmonized criteria.
This is an urgent step that had to be taken, an open Europe with an open borders at the same time.
The Member States will have received clear rules on how there to process these requests the of course.
The traveler will have to turn to the main country of travel to get the entry visas.
Of course the rules here on the entry visas will mean that the travel will be facilitated for many different people all sorts of people such as since people but travelers from all over the world holidaymakers who actually make up the biggest bulk of people who come into the country.
Now we can't rely on American Standards.
When it comes to using standards in the International System, now a new set of European options.
We've proposed a number of points which we believe should be borne in mind in drawing up new standards.
And from that analysis we could work out what the conservatives have contributed to exaggerated neoliberalism in the US.
Use the chance and learn from history so that we can have social Europe demoncracy and and we don't satisfy ourselves with these small details of the Lisbon treaty.
I'll give you an example from Germany an example of how you can do things wrong.
Josef Ackermann in the Deutsche Bank when he traded in his company car for a new Porsche Cayenne, he gets four thousand Euros in cash.
Thank you, Mr Queiro.
I use motorbike rather than the car. But I also like to avoid dying on a motorbike.
Sometimes there are airports a few kilometers from one country border and one airport say the other side of the border in two different Member States.
We want to be sure that there isn't unfair competition in such situations.
So I think these new criteria are quite right.
I thank the President for his generosity and the Comissioner for his excellent answer.
Can the Comission however, definitively rule out the cloning of people in any form being part of this strategy now or in the future.
Our next item is the hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day.
Will now show a brief a short movie that on that topic.
But I think that we need to understand when we're talking about China that if we're talking about violence on the part of a centralized State we need to look at the fact that the country remains a multicultural country and that this means that we can expect such problems to recur in the future.
Now if we're talking about cultural autonomy, freedom to cherish your identity and your culture. These are preconditions for multi-ethnic state to function.
We can't simply can't accept more cuts in this area.
I'm aware of the fact that there's an erroneous interpretation to protection of the requirements of type approval in certain Member States.
And it's a wrong interpretation and it's not in line with the legal framework that has been created and the Comission will ensure that the necessary clarifications will be issued so that any negative consequences do not occur.
We need to have buildings that are more energy efficient, and we need to use renewable sources of energy to heat them and that's the first step.
We simply want to ensure that we people are not circumventing the law on providing information through claims of intellectual property. And I think we've managed to achieve a good solution here.
Is that we need to continue to consider to ensure that Health Care in Member States remains within the remit of Member States in accordance with the EU treaty.
IE Member States determine how these systems are financed and we can't touch this through EU legislation.
We can't do that and we don't want to do that unless of course, we agree ultimately that we have a common health policy in the EU.
That would be the best solution, but we're sadly in nowhere near that at the moment.
Well, I don't have a grabber European cyclical program a sort of umbrella over the whole industrial sector of Automotive manufacturing.
I would say that we've got to foster eco friendly emission low products.
I'm absolutely convinced that the competition policy as such won't have to be changed from the proposals.
