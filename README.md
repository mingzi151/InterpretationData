# InterpretationData
This repository is for our EMNLP 2021 paper: It is Not as Good as You Think! Evaluating Simultaneous Machine Translation on Interpretation Data

There are two stages in our human annotation process: 1) segmentation; 2) ASR error correction.
You can find our Interpretation test sets after each stage in `noised-interpretation` and `clean-interpretation`, respectively.
The corresponding Translation test set can be found in `clean-translation`.
