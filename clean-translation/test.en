I expressly welcome the fact that the Commission has already taken a positive stance in relation to several proposals from the Parliament.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who has taken up many of the proposals from the Committee on Regional Development in relation to modulation and rural development.
The Committee on Regional Development and a large number of other colleagues believe that the exemption limit should be increased to a maximum of EUR 10 000.
On 22 June 2012, the Senate of the Republic of Paraguay removed the directly elected President, Fernando Lugo, from office.
The EU is indeed much more united than people say.
If we remain so, we can achieve something in the Middle East .
So we must continue in this direction.
There are still two drops of bitterness, though: my proposal that democratic control should, for the first time, be implemented via parliamentary monitoring was unfortunately rejected in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
We are not talking here about products, but about dangerous, hazardous goods, and I therefore feel that informal trialogues – as they are so innocuously called, whether they relate to the climate-change package or to toys or to other laws – do not belong in a modern parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safety is a sacred thing.
What has happened in Berlin recently, where the suburban rapid rail system has gone to pieces as a result of profits being prioritised, must remain an absolutely exceptional case.
Mr President, first, my compliments on the rapporteur’s splendid work.
My dear Claude, a most sincere thank you!
Medium-sized enterprises are not supplicants but the core of our European economy. Only if we give them the framework.
Let me also make it quite clear – and this applies to the audience in the gallery as well – that it is not acceptable for speakers and audience alike to have no chance of hearing what is being said because so many private discussions are taking place in the gangways of the Chamber.
I would therefore ask you to take your seats; otherwise, I will not allow the debate to resume.
According to Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure, it will therefore be submitted to the addressees indicated and will be published in the minutes as a text adopted in this session, also bearing the names of the signatories.
However, I would have liked to congratulate the Secretary-General jointly with another Member of this House, and because the person concerned is such a remarkable Member, I thought I would wait until he was also in the Chamber, which he now is.
Our former President, Jerzy Buzek, is celebrating his birthday today.
Many happy returns, Mr President.
The second written declaration has been submitted by Mrs Hall, Mrs Ayala Sender, Mrs Durant, Mr Koch and Mrs Wils on heavy goods vehicle collisions.
It has been signed by the majority of Parliament’s component Members.
Therefore, in accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the of this sitting, together with the names of the signatories.
If money is needed for these structural changes, it must be found in unused agricultural and structural funds.
Agricultural policy will remain contradictory and imponderable as long as it continues to be pushed back and forth in this way.
Therefore, we, the Committee on Regional Development, are calling for planning security for the rural development programmes and for farmers’ incomes.
Both of these will only be possible if we strictly separate the operational approach of compensation payments from regional programmes in the future.
In a debate last November about the European Union's role in globalisation, I made the following comment:
"The Wild West capitalism that dominates the financial markets is threatening entire economies, including the US economy now, and needs international rules.
We need control, transparency and restrictions on the power of the financial markets."
In response, the leader of the ALDE said: "Mr President, we have just heard the language of the past".
At least he is not present for today's debate, which will obviously enhance its quality.
What I said, however, was not the language of the past. Now, more than ever, control and government supervision of a deregulated market – which has no respect for anything or anyone – are the way forward.
Carbon leakage is an entry point to a kind of liberation. This is still far from meaning that industry, which we believe will be freed, is really going to be freed by the Commission.
The same goes for the benchmarking system.
Minister, with all due respect and to you too, Mrs Doyle, we must be immensely careful lest in the future our Commission become the lord and master of economic policy in Europe.
That is why I have my doubts, but will in the end nevertheless vote for the report, since in retrospect this concerns not only CO2, but also sustainability.
Too little is said about this in this House.
We are burning away our children’s resources at an appalling rate, and thereby endangering our planet. This must be turned around by a new policy for the industrial society.
There is already a framework at EU level laying down exposure limits and production standards and also a defined level of protection in terms of known effects.
I shall turn now to the individual points of this report.
But we do have common security interests. The protection of our citizens within and beyond the Union, peace in our neighbourhood, the protection of our external borders, the protection of our critical infrastructures, energy security, the security of our trade routes, the security of our assets at the global level and many other things represent, in reality, individual security interests and common security interests of the European Union.
If we now resume talks with Russia – something we are in favour of – it is, in our opinion, very important that we do not forget that there is also Karabakh, Chechnya, Moldova.
And Transnistria.
And that we will also have to cope with a very difficult dispute in Ukraine in the next decade in relation to the Crimea.
The European Union must not make the same mistake it made prior to the war in Georgia by not taking this conflict seriously enough.
I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets.
In the light of the public interest in the preservation of biodiversity and in fighting climate change.
I hope that the Commission will now at least comply with our request to present annual reports on the implementation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement and on its interaction with bilateral agreements.
Normally, the rule, in this Parliament as well as elsewhere, is that a substance is banned if it has been demonstrated to be harmful.
In this case, it is the other way round.
Substances are banned.
They are then only authorised if they can be definitively demonstrated to be safe.
I would like to know what more we could be expected to do.
We cannot do any more than is being done here, and anybody who gives the impression that what we have done here does not provide adequate protection for children.
I am sorry to say – deliberately misleading the European public.
I cannot imagine why you would do that.
As agreed in the negotiations that led to agreement at first reading, the Commission is issuing a statement.
And this is your opportunity to take Europe forward.
I should like to express my thanks and my confidence in successful cooperation to come.
Mumbai will happen again. There will be another Mumbai, just as past disasters have been repeated.
Realise this and, I urge you to be prepared for it.
The economic importance of this is also not to be underestimated. Taxpayers’ money will in future be used more efficiently.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new proposal submitted by the Commission is urgently needed.
The members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal.
It is essential that we go beyond the confines of the Daphne Programme.
And introduce legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography.
Of course, this is also the responsibility of the users.
For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution.
We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality.
Before I give the President of the Commission the floor, I would like to welcome warmly the two ministers Bernard Kouchner and Jean Louis Borloo who have made a significant contribution to the success of the Presidency.
What I do not understand is that the Barroso Commission.
Does not want to develop and demonstrate its greatest success: the disclosure of the recipients of subsidies.
Why are you not using this to disclose how EU money is being spent?
Why are you not analysing whether we are actually achieving our political goals using the information gained from this data?
The Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament’s expenditure.
The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues.
The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone.
At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument.
Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs.
We should explain here that clear and simple regulations.
Easier to follow than complex and comprehensive ones.
This is why I am specifically calling on the Council to improve the basic conditions as quickly as possible.
We need OLAF for transparency and justice in Europe.
Create a European area of higher education.
Students must have a broad spectrum of choice, a wide range of high-quality courses.
The three-cycle system of bachelor’s degrees, master’s degrees and doctorates.
Today we are signing into law a European Systemic Risk Board .
It will be responsible for the oversight of the financial system within the Union and will contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to remind the Kingdom of its duty to respect human rights.
Firstly, in a debate about our cooperation with Israel, in which human rights and the humanitarian problems of the Palestinians are rightly discussed.
It should not, however, be forgotten that we have a particular responsibility towards Israel.
It is determined by the fact that the mere existence of the State of Israel has something to do with European history and that a particular responsibility results from this.
Is there a credible comparison between the attractiveness of the US Green Card and comparable systems, and what we want to do in Europe?
So the task of the EU is to drive things forward with energy and determination instead of degenerating into a disunited talking shop, which – unfortunately – we have been in recent years in the matter of Middle East policy.
That the national safety authorities issue their safety certificates and authorisations in accordance with what is laid down by the European Railway Agency (ERA).
Are there adequate controls? Is it ensured, for example, that the training of the staff, the certifications and the working conditions are properly monitored?
What is the situation, in this regard, with respect to the introduction of a standardised Community certification?
What is the situation with regard to the European train driver’s licence?
However – and this also needs to be emphasised – equal partnership means addressing problems honestly.
That is still not happening with India, and nor is it evident in the resolution before us.
That is why we are unfortunately unable to support this compromise.
The forthcoming European elections are one of the priorities of interinstitutional public relations.
The Commission supports and supplements Parliament’s campaign to put in place information measures to increase public awareness of these elections and to call on citizens to exercise their electoral rights.
Mr Matsakis, thank you for this declaration.
I would remind you, the freedom of the press in Kenya.
Russian gas, Europeans collectively must answer the question as to what relationship they actually want to have with Russia in future.
Gas is just one issue, the trade in raw materials is just one issue.
But we are talking about the fundamental relationship of the European Union with its largest neighbour on the east of our continent, and that does need to be clarified.
We call for an immediate national dialogue with the representatives of all the political forces in the country, as advocated by Professor Bassiouni and the Commission of Inquiry.
I must re-emphasise that we are nationalising losses, and that cannot be right.
The objective of the Treaty of Lisbon is to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the 21st century.
We have to face up to the fears of our citizens about energy issues, rising unemployment, immigration and climate change.
We will have to act together, just as we have done many times in the past.
And we must not forget that the key to success is the principle of European solidarity.
We believe that proper commemoration of the victims depends on our knowing about this tragedy, this massive crime on the part of the Soviet regime.
The dispute between Macedonia and Greece over names is a bilateral affair and should have no repercussions.
And who secondly argued in favour of Macedonia’s accession to NATO as quickly as possible two very important points.
Firstly, the directive brings about security of investment, for we have binding targets of at least 20%.
We have binding national targets, very detailed national action plans, and interim targets that will be strictly monitored by the Commission.
That will put enough pressure on the 27 Member States to concentrate massively on wind, solar, water and biomass.
I know we need diversification.
We also face a problematic and very difficult situation to the east with Russia and the transit countries of Belarus and Ukraine.
However, diversification must not involve us now entering into relations with despots and countries in crisis.
I would firstly like to touch on the situation in the Mediterranean, which, as we all know, is changing very rapidly.
The European Parliament was and is ready to lend its support to democratic changes initiated by the citizens themselves, who are our European neighbours.
When we hold our debate today on Tunisia, we will be discussing a partner country which has already taken the first steps on the path towards true democracy.
Just a short while ago, I met the Tunisian Foreign Affairs Minister, and I was accompanied by five other Members of the European Parliament.
Madam Vice-President, you mentioned this earlier – that the European Union must maintain its commitment to the fundamental principle of the social market economy.
At an individual level, that is a difficult balancing act whose outcome may, of course, vary according to one's political standpoint.
We have put an end to war and starvation.
Today, we live in a free and open Europe, a Europe that can be proud of its cultural diversity.
Let us now arm Europe for the 21st century.
So that it will also be a promise of economic strength, social justice and a free and democratic European homeland for the younger generation, for our children and grandchildren.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now, and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law.
Today, therefore, is a day of joy for me, when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years, when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing.
Unless agreement is reached tomorrow on a binding long-term target, my group will be unable to vote for this directive.
I am sorry, Mr Dimas.
We must make an example of this directive.
I am also particularly pleased that the European Parliament has succeeded in anchoring bee protection as a licensing criterion for the first time.
Leading scientists have estimated the economic value of pollinators at EUR 150 billion per annum and the damage at up to EUR 310 billion if we lost bees as pollinators.
Any amendments that have been submitted.
It used to be common practice not to attempt to attack a joint compromise again.
However, I am pleased that we have jointly achieved an improvement for immunotoxic and neurotoxic substances.
In a Europe that purports to be a knowledge-based society, we cannot afford to allow the development of a child's brain to be impaired primarily through neurotoxic substances in the long term.
We can say quite clearly yes to harmonisation, however, without restricting the laws of the Member States .
Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses.
With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas.
The issuing of visas, the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints.
The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament’s original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group.
I very much welcome the strategy set out in the White Paper, which will enable us to tackle the causes of poor nutrition and obesity and the diseases with which they are associated.
Unfortunately, in Europe's food policy, whether we are talking about nutrient profiles or food labelling, or indeed in some aspects of the White Paper, we tend to resort to a very one-sided approach.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, CO2 is not poisonous.
CO2 is not explosive, but CO2 does have one unpleasant property.
Speaking on behalf of the Bureau of the European Parliament.
I think, on behalf of the majority of fellow Members in this Chamber.
We are determined to pursue a zero tolerance policy towards the actions which have led to the resignations of our fellow Members.
That the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation – possibly for authorisation throughout Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I have a question for Commissioner Verheugen: is the Commission ready to prepare a legal basis for a budget line for the 2009 or 2010 budget?
The second question is: would it be possible to give priority to action plans.
The current need for support for small and medium-sized businesses because precisely now, as a result of the financial crisis, this Small Business Act has become particularly important?
Can you envisage us being able to start an immediate action programme in this area?
According to Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure, it will therefore be submitted to the addressees indicated and will be published in the minutes as a text adopted in this session, also bearing the names of the signatories.
As you have been so nice.
The future of the European motor industry will be a green one or this industry will not have a future in Europe.
People can argue about whether the choice of models produced by European manufacturers, especially the German manufacturers, was responsible for the crisis we are now in.
There have been environmentally-friendly cars in the past, and low-consumption models too – think of Mercedes’.
It is not quite as black and white as you might think.
From an environmental point of view, the choice of models was clearly wrong and the fact that the changeover is being made now, in a crisis, does not make it easier.
But that does not change the fact that this changeover is necessary and needs to take place quickly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aiming to work together to attain the best conditions for the provision of health care in Europe.
Especially in rural areas of the European Union close to national borders the advancement of patient mobility, which we were just debating, is a particularly important building block for improving the provision of health care and making it more efficient.
In everything we do, however, we must adhere to and retain the ethical standards of the Member States.
This applies to DNA analysis just as it does to artificial insemination, and it also applies to rare diseases, the subject of Mr Trakatellis’s report.
Rare diseases need a stronger political framework in order to improve research and treatment, as companies prefer to invest in large markets.
However, what we see is something else.
A boycott on certain media and the Dohan group has been hit with an arbitrary tax penalty of EUR 400 million.
This is an arbitrary measure which brings us to the question of the rule of law, which is as important to liberals as freedom of the press.
Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for this engaged debate. As a first point, I would like to thank the Commission, in the person of Commissioner Verheugen, for reading out the declaration on the implementing measures here in the House today.
This matter had really given us some headaches and been a cause for concern.
It was good for it to be played out in public here again.
Many of the other perpetrators are also still at large, and some are even still living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
We have before us one of the most important decisions in this parliamentary term.
For it is to us that the citizens of Europe have committed the task of electing the best European Commission.
For the first time in history, we are electing the European Commission as a co-equal legislator.
This puts us under an obligation to work especially closely with the European Commission.
In relation to this, we have entered, provisionally, into a new Framework Agreement, and today we are going to endorse it. We are going to vote on this agreement at 12.00.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr van Nistelrooij once said that this was about defining the ‘fifth freedom’.
The fifth freedom is simply the freedom of researchers, who cannot be tied to regional, national or international level.
For reasons of restraint we have not yet stated this loudly and clearly, but I believe that it is time to explain that this Parliament is behind the Treaty of Lisbon and it would be a good thing if the Parliament could succeed in putting it into force before the European elections.
This is not within our power, but I think that it is our position.
The issue of urban mobility was first raised by the transport commissioner, Jacques Barrot, over two years ago now, and it resulted in a Green Paper by the European Commission, which submitted its conclusions to us in spring 2007.
The Commission adopted an action plan towards an integrated internal control framework.
As stated in our report, there is no doubt that the Commission has made some serious efforts to develop the action plan.
However, it is quite clear to Parliament that the implementation of the measures is a long way behind schedule.
Therefore, the Commission must speed up the implementation of the envisaged measures considerably.
So that positive effects can be seen in the ECA’s Annual Report in the foreseeable future and also so that we Members of the European Parliament can grant a budget discharge with a clear conscience.
To force Ukraine – but not only Ukraine – into its planned agricultural economy.
This objective was prized more highly in the eyes of the rulers of the time than preserving human life. No consideration whatsoever was given to the people and millions suffered an agonising death.
This means that the Holodomor was not a natural disaster; it was planned by man and executed in cold blood.
The euro was brought into the world and it has been a success.
At the time, Gordon Brown was President-in-Office of the Council, and he stated quite clearly back then that the European Parliament had played a major role in the historic process of monetary union.
Other players also spoke, including Jacques Santer, and also Wilfried Maartens, who at the time described the countries in the Euro Zone – first 11, then 15, then 16 of them – as the pioneers of a courageous Europe.
We are calling for the peace negotiations to be resumed as soon as possible, as we are convinced that there cannot merely be a military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
As a political actor, we are now under obligation and have a responsibility to do everything we can to enable the people in the Middle East to live together in peace.
A prerequisite for peace between Israel and Palestine is intra-Palestinian reconciliation.
The European Parliament unreservedly supports the ongoing talks, led in particular by Egypt, to smooth the way to the formation of a Palestinian government of national consensus.
Only this type of government will be in a position to ensure the required unity of the Palestinian people.
There is no switch that we can flick, not in Brussels nor in Bali nor in Poland in December; instead we have a whole host of measures.
This is precisely where the opportunity lies: the opportunity to make it clear to the people that they themselves are responsible for a third of this climate change, for example as a result of them heating their houses.
As citizens, however, we are all responsible for a third, including as a result of mobility and all that entails, and industry is also responsible for a third.
The report is therefore directed at us all. That is the wonderful thing about it.
We are all urged to take part in innovative discussions.
Four great world leaders were there: the President of the United States, George Bush senior, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher and the President of France, François Mitterrand, and, of course, the foreign ministers of the four countries, negotiating the reunification treaty.
Thirdly, as well as ensuring that social spending is financially secure through the use of joint contributions and hybrid fund-based solutions, we must put the focus on social investment.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the Czech Council Presidency on its assumption of office.
This is the first Council Presidency from a former Warsaw Pact country and therefore of symbolic importance, as Mr Nassauer rightly said.
Mr President, this part of the climate package is one of the most important parts.
Because the automotive industry lies at the heart of the economies of many of our Member States.
That is why this chapter had to be closed now, so that the automotive industry can focus on the crisis plaguing it and will not need to keep battling with what figures it must or can achieve.
We all know that the Dayton Agreement has, on the one hand, brought peace; on the other hand, however, it has created a very complicated structure with various governments and parliaments.
In other words, you have another ten cantons and need about 13 home secretaries to pass an asylum law in this country.
The political process would probably take some beating in terms of complexity.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, I can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the House.
What we have, of course, is a compromise, and there is always scope to want a little bit more in such cases.
I can also say that I, personally, and the Commission would have been prepared to go a step further.
What we have now is what we were able to achieve, however, and it represents a major step forward.
The Austrian police stopped a truck containing137 puppies.
The journey started in Slovakia and was due to end in Spain.
In Europe we really need comprehensive inspections of animal transportation and corresponding threats of fines in the event of non-compliance.
A criticism that I have to make is that much of the debate about the financial disaster and the way in which the emerging or already real climate catastrophe is being pushed aside reminds me of the German after the Second World War.
Many members of parliament and many politicians in the no longer had any interest in what had happened up to 1945.
That is the starting point: unless you conquer the past, examine your own mistakes and look to the future, there is no way forwards.
I should like to draw attention to one point, however, against which we would speak out most decisively, as I am of the opinion that Parliament has made a mistake.
We should not be replacing the crime of ‘public provocation to commit a terrorist offence’ with the crime of ‘incitement to commit a terrorist offence’, for the very simple reason that proof of incitement cannot be provided until the act has already taken place; that is, until people may have already died.
We are in favour of the possibility of timely intervention when a terrorist act has not yet been committed – that is, beforehand – so that lives can be saved.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is good that we at least agree on jointly prosecuting four common offences.
But what is important in reality is that these traffic offences really are punished, not just that we say we agree that numerous offences should be prosecuted.
I will keep you informed of developments as they happen.
That will boost Europe's acceptance and we will probably all be re-elected by more of Europe's citizens than was the case at the last election.
I would like to thank Mr Barroso for presenting the point of view of the European Commission.
How we are going to coordinate the 2020 Strategy in the future – this, too, needs to be based on the Community method.
I welcome the package of measures supported by the European Parliament, which ranges from hotlines to the installation of blocking systems and education.
However, I do agree fully with Mr Bösch that the Council must be involved.
I appeal to you – at one minute to 12 – to utilise the 21 days up to 26 May to incorporate the resolution to be adopted tomorrow by Parliament into your Regulation in order to meet car dealers half way without jeopardising the direction the Commission wishes to take.
Please take Parliament and the concerns of the car dealers seriously.
I could see us also supporting assistance in this area, for example within the framework of the Competition and Innovation Programme.
We have the Intelligent Energy Programme and we also have the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
Do you believe that overall, these developments are a good or a bad thing?
Will the situation become more or less dangerous?
If it is becoming more dangerous, what plans does the Commission have with particular regard to this change in the Internet?
We have found and jointly negotiated a whole series of points in the compromise in order to make the programme more attractive.
The threshold for traffic displacement projects has been reduced from 80 to 60 million tonne-kilometres, as has the threshold for inland waterway projects, where Parliament pushed through a reduction from 17 to 13 million tonne-kilometres.
We have also increased the permissible funding level for additional infrastructures from 10% to 20%.
The Commission would be well advised not even to appear to be attempting to do this. Commissioner, I am on the warpath about this subject.
I know that you will reject this point later as unacceptable and that you will insist on this. I think that is a pity!
The Parliament will definitely not expose you to the temptation of sweeping the findings of investigations involving EU employees under the Commission's carpet.
Mr President, 10 years of the euro is indeed a reason to celebrate.
Anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it has done would have been laughed at.
Many people have contributed to this success.
And I remember many sceptical voices – it was referred to as a premature baby .
The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this, of the milestones, of the European monetary system, which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates, of the Delors report, which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages, of the Treaty of Maastricht – only two years after the fall of the Wall – and of the transitional periods.
Many people have helped to make the euro the successful project it is today.
To answer the other question as well, namely on what we are doing to ensure that this directive is implemented, in other words to enforce it.
The Commission will report to Parliament regularly, since it is clear to all of us that we are entering uncharted waters here.
And this step must also be supported by regular checks and by building trust among the Member States.
Due to the size of the internal market and due to the euro, the Union has undoubtedly got a better chance of overcoming the crisis.
However the Union also has obligations and it must fulfil its obligations to the sovereign and to the citizens, by protecting them from unbridled greed and the consequences of globalisation.
Mrs Torstensson, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members.
The legal acts which constitute the ‘Telecom’ package were enacted in a codecision procedure.
Electronic communication and the internet have become the main tools of our modern societies.
This legislative package is a good example of how our work can help people and how it can affect their everyday lives.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I am in the chair, I have to read you a communication which states that, at its meeting on Monday, 9 March, the Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a motion for a resolution on the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka.
Regarding third-party certification, the belief that a toy, or any product, in Europe will be made safer because it has been certified by a third-party body is, unfortunately, a baseless one.
The Commission really has now had the results for many years with respect to product safety.
There is nothing – absolutely nothing – to suggest that third-party certification makes any products safer.
And this is a principle of European legislation that this House has observed for very many years.
Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security.
It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom.
Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being.
Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU’s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control.
This will mean the shredding of people’s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality.
The other thing I wanted to say I will direct at my British friends, and ‘across all the parties’.
My dear British friends, I do understand, Caroline, I can see your problem.
I can well understand that the energy security of a country will be put above compliance with an air pollution limit for a certain period of time.
I am also the last person who would fail to grant Her Majesty additional time when it comes to building new coal-fired power stations.
This is something that we can talk about. The problem is that that is exactly what we have not done.
No one wants to impose some sort of congestion charge or other rules on communities.
But if they are used, then they should be used within a framework which citizens recognise.
We have been in agreement on the sense in taking a common approach to traffic signs for over 100 years.
This should also apply in future to this issue.
We also invited the Israeli President, Shimon Peres.
Unfortunately, due to Israel’s celebrations marking 60 years as a nation, the agreed appointment could not be kept.
We should also ensure that universities do everything in their power to take advantage of funding opportunities in order to make it easier for students to exercise their mobility if they wish to do so.
For many universities, this will mean coming out of their ivory towers and linking up with the business community.
How many large companies would consider it an honour to sponsor a doctorate or master’s course?
If it meant that a master’s course had to bear the name of Mercedes or Sony or some other corporate brand, so be it!
The point is that the sponsorship money would help students.
It is not a matter of selling anyone the right to stipulate the content of the curriculum but of locating sources of funding that really do enable anyone who is interested to study abroad.
If we make progress towards the achievement of these goals with the aid of the Commission, we shall all be well content.
That is not so for every subject area.
But in this case it is. They are making demands of us.
I just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses. In this connection, local politics, chambers of commerce and industry and trade associations can achieve a considerable amount in terms of motivation and the provision of information.
I do not know if there are great differences between Member States or groups.
But what is certain is that, in the debate we have had here, no difference could be noted; from Germany to Poland, from the United Kingdom to Portugal, Spain or Cyprus.
I believe there has been considerable unanimity in support for the initiative.
There are, however, many other considerations, for which we also need other solutions, be it because people are travelling or are working in other countries or be it because they have a rare disease or because they will receive better care in another country.
This means that there is also a need to remove the obstacles to mobility in such cases and to ensure that legal certainty is created.
That is the second priority.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of effective internal control is one of the most important budgetary principles that the Commission must observe when implementing the budget and utilising the funds. The European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Parliament have been calling for effective, efficient control of the budgetary resources for years, and numerous attempts and suggestions have been made by the ECA, in particular, seeking to ensure that the Commission uses these resources appropriately and economically.
Nevertheless, the ECA has not been able to give the Commission a positive statement of assurance for years.
I need only remind the House of the occurrences in connection with irregularities in the implementation of the Leonardo programme a few years ago, and other support areas that have always been very susceptible to irregularities and perhaps even to fraud.
I hope that we will use that opportunity for a plan that is supported by major economic and environmental groups. Please support the compromises! Thank you.
Given the tragedy that has struck the region of Murcia and specifically, the town of Lorca, I should like to express, on behalf of the Presidency, our solidarity with that community and with all the victims, several of whom have been killed.
The President will convey, on behalf of Parliament, a message of solidarity and condolence to the victims and to the community affected.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has submitted a proposal concerning the debate on cases of breaches of human rights.
The group proposes replacing the debate on Madagascar with a debate on the death penalty, particularly the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
We decided that we shall call for censorship of advertising, that we want to ban artificial trans-fatty acids but intend at the same time to indicate TFA content on food labels, that our waistline will be officially measured in future and that the salt content in food will be monitored, which is tantamount to demanding intervention in food recipes.
A new definition of healthy eating has been initiated; one of the stipulations is that healthy eating is possible only with organic produce.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission Vice-President, I completely agree with the Vice-President’s statements.
We have to differentiate between the straits where there are responsible countries with whom we can cooperate on cracking down on piracy, and the maritime operations where there is no responsible country, for example in Somalia, where we have to do something ourselves.
The fact that the European Union has such a poor public image unfortunately has a great deal to do with OLAF.
I agree with the previous speaker that OLAF is neither fish nor fowl and it takes a characteristically arbitrary approach.
OLAF employees have been coming to me and telling me how depressing things are, that two types of measurements are used and that no clear standards are set.
One OLAF employee even compared OLAF's practices with those of the secret police, in other words, an undemocratic institution.
The occasion was, of course, once again the so-called Galvin report, the internal report in which many of the practices of Members of the European Parliament are disclosed which, if OLAF were to use the same standards, would have led to large-scale investigations, including one of Herbert Bösch, who refers to himself as the father of OLAF.
Mr President, Commissioner, I hold you personally in high esteem, but what is happening here really is an intolerable mess.
For this reason, I call not only on the Commission but also on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control to look in detail at this question.
We in Europe know what the price of freedom is; what the price of freedom of thought is.
On 16 December, exactly 28 years ago, strikers were killed in the Wujek coal mine by the Polish communist police because they fought for solidarity; that is, for basic human rights, for dignity.
Twenty years ago, on 16 December in Romania, a revolution started which claimed the lives of over 1 000 people because they fought for their freedom.
Already in 2007, a third of Europeans lived in regions in which water resources were limited, according to the European Environment Agency. This problem particularly affects countries such as Cyprus, Bulgaria, Belgium, Hungary, Malta, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and, unfortunately, many others.
Drought events have therefore become more frequent over the last 30 years.
The EU economy suffered losses of approximately EUR 8.7 billion in the drought of 2003.
These extreme weather situations have not only economic, but also social and human effects.
Apart from the general impairment of human health, approximately 35 000 people in Europe died.
I would like to remind you that from our point of view, ‘mainstreaming’ is extremely important. It is vital for water policy to be included in all other areas of policy and politics, as my colleague Mr Berend has also pointed out.
European funds must not be used in ways that contribute to short- or long-term water scarcity.
Everyone must realise that water is not an infinite resource. My colleague Mrs Doyle mentioned water pricing.
But here the Member States have a wide scope and the necessary flexibility, and their traditions must be taken into account.
We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important.
It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it – as with the SWIFT agreement, for example – to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process.
That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer.
In the light of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, President Pöttering wrote to the Secretary-General of the Council in January and explained that, in our view, this agreement establishes a specific institutional framework and therefore requires Parliament’s assent under Article 300(3)(2) of the EC Treaty.
The reply – four whole paragraphs – did not contain any kind of legal argument or any other grounds for rejecting Parliament’s request.
It was in this context that the Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Mrs Lucas, the present oral question and the corresponding resolution we are debating here.
I would like to point out that it is not the President who has been kind and given more time to speak.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one of the previous speakers stated that the principle behind all of this must be ‘no force’. No force from either side, as enshrined in international law.
We must insist that international law is upheld, including territorial integrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of another state, no exertion of influence and adherence to the agreements of August and September.
All this cannot be achieved by the Member States alone; it can only be achieved as a Community task.
Intelligent transport systems based on EU-wide compulsory minimum underlying standards and specifications improve the environment for innovation and create planning security.
At the same time, however, it became apparent that the European Council has a structural weakness, and that is its unanimity principle. In my opinion, we will not emerge from the crisis while this unanimity principle exists.
While we respect the goal that we also share, this is a significant abuse of the rights of Parliament and its Members.
Energy efficiency and renewable energies are the solution for a better and more secure energy supply, and I have to say, Mr Barroso, you have tolerated a great deal in this regard.
Mr Oettinger has once again chosen not to promote future-proof technologies such as renewable energies and energy efficiency and has reverted to the old energy mix.
That feed-in tariffs for nuclear power stations, for atomic energy, are to be discussed at the summit.
Madam President, thank you.
I believe that we can best measure the progress we have made by what we set as the goal at the beginning of the debate.
I remember the situation at the start as being one in which Mrs Kroes presented an analysis showing that, despite several liberalisation packages at European level, the market power is held by fewer and fewer players – large energy companies – in ever more EU Member States, in other words the concentration is increasing in the energy sector in relation to electricity just as it is in relation to gas.
I was therefore pleased at the start of the debate that both the Commission and then later the European Parliament said that the most effective instrument to combat this concentration.
The European institutional system stipulates that a Green Paper must be followed by a White Paper.
In the case in point, it was European Commission proposals for action plans on urban mobility that were on the table.
Have you considered putting in place certain controls on these microloans to encourage people to focus on fair trade or organic cultivation?
Mr President, as the Committee on Culture and Education’s rapporteur for the new anti-discrimination directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, I warmly welcome the Commission’s proposal and would specifically like to thank Mr Špidla.
It is our task as co-legislators to ensure that a Working Time Directive contains minimum standards compatible with health.
I want to urge you, at this point – looking forward to second reading now – to be open-minded once again and to say ‘let us talk about a compromise now’ and, to that end, to give up the resistance – which, in my view, is completely irrational – and the fundamental opposition to the minimum standards, which is unjustifiable from the point of view of either competition policy or environmental policy.
I think that a compromise can be reached on this, something I also hope to see at the end of the second reading.
Thank you, Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Vălean, in particular, but also Commissioner Reding, who showed great commitment in the negotiations for the Roaming II Regulation.
I believe that these negotiations and, of course, also the objective of bringing the national prices and the prices that we pay in the other European countries onto the same level, are an important step forward.
Many thanks for your visit, Mr President,
Mr Rasmussen has had to deal in particular with the effects on the financial markets and the Committee on Legal Affairs with its expertise naturally concerned itself in particular with the aspects of company law and, where necessary, with the need to change European company law.
I did so at the beginning, in the presence of Prime Minister Topolánek.
I would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution.
We want to encourage you to continue as you have just said, so that the Czech Presidency will be as successful in its second half as it was in its first half.
Good luck for the continuation of your work.
A few days ago I was at a large conference near Rome. The first item discussed there, of course, was that of the banks. On the Thursday the newspaper headlines read: Morgan Stanley offers hope.
On Friday, they read: Morgan Stanley seeks protection.
If, after Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, this investment bank is also now sinking in the chaos of the financial markets, corrective action should be taken as a matter of urgency.
The terms must be clear. The car companies must use the money to switch to a smaller, more efficient range of products, to alternative propulsion systems – not only for the environment, nor merely for the climate, but also for the long-term security of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Firstly, because this resolution links this catastrophe and this crime to Ukraine and people of Ukrainian nationality alone.
As I said at the beginning, this does not reflect the historical truth.
Many thanks, Madam President, many thanks, Commissioner, As Mr Surján said, the available budget is tight – 1% of gross national product.
Thus we must be all the more careful with the funds, particularly in view of the crisis weighing on people’s minds.
I am obliged to Mr Barrot for expressing his views so clearly and for his willingness to speak to our fellow politicians in Sweden once again – as I am still at a loss.
And the thanks directed towards the French Presidency are absolutely and completely justified.
Minister, please would you pass these thanks on to all the institutions? Thank you very much.
The fact that the practical reality can be quite different is something that a few Members of this House can testify.
I have seen on the list of speakers that Mr Guardans Cambó, Mr Karim and Mrs Mann intend to speak on this issue.
They will certainly be telling us something of their experiences in Mumbai last December.
Even though only three Member States do not have an embassy in New Delhi and that only seven do not maintain a consulate in Mumbai.
Thank you, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Let me say to you that I have already been following this whole development very attentively for some time now.
We must maintain absolute transparency, because, as you know, these people who attack us demand that we act transparently – and they themselves, of course, should practise what they preach.
There is no doubt that the compromise reached in the area of the European patent, for example, does not set a good example of how to proceed.
We are firmly convinced that together, in the interests of the people of Europe, we should do everything we can to emerge from this crisis swiftly and stronger than before.
Thus, for example, there are major unexplained differences in the figures for requests for information received and requests for information answered. The mirror image differences in the statistics for intra-Community trade.
I would take this opportunity to ask the Commission when the results of the study will be presented to us.
Anyone reading the title of my report, or rather the report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which adopted it unanimously, namely ‘Report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming’, must realise that it represents only part of the actual content of the report.
However, we are now faced with the question of what to do about the Member States which have been part of the EU since 1981?
I would like to ask the Commission – and this is one of the lessons which I have learnt from this – to acknowledge that the more consistent the Commission's actions are, the faster we will have improved results.
I would also like to see this consistent approach being taken in the area.
I am disappointed that there has been so little progress on direct management.
Firstly, we would urgently appeal for some support for Romania and Bulgaria in establishing the rule of law, the justice system and financial control.
We do not want to be in the same position in two years' time.
So this issue is very important to us.
I would like to see the same tough approach which the Member States sometimes use.
Of course, we must speak to our colleagues in the national parliaments to encourage them to demand that illegal immigrants be granted the rights which have been decided on here.
If someone is employed illegally because he can no longer survive in his own country, he does not have the option of going to the police and saying that he is being exploited.
I hope that by setting these priorities we can also manage to reduce the statistical burden for medium-sized companies in the medium term, as we will be able to search for data which we actually need for our statistics in an even more targeted way.
I hope that the vote is completed quickly tomorrow.
Mr President, the large degree of euphoria surrounding the democratic progress made by Turkey as a result of the most recent referendum needs to be put into perspective.
Because Turkey has so far not managed to cooperate with the EU with regard to the return of refugees and migrants.
In this regard, Turkey is not only a country of origin. Cooperation in our joint defence against refugees is, however, essential.
Although Frontex is available to help with technological matters, it does not, of course, mean that the EU has to bear the general costs of Turkish border protection.
The EU cannot be Ankara’s cash cow.
Turkey must therefore comply with the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees to refuse to return refugees.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, owing to the short time available to me, I should like to discuss only the report by Mrs Roure.
When we talk about the processing of personal data in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, I should like to say very clearly that I am of the opinion that we need uniform European regulations.
Our fear now is that in 2013 we will face a linear decrease.
In relation to the figures currently being mentioned by the Commission it must be said that the mountain has given birth to a mouse.
This proposal is lukewarm.
But the action you propose is quite ridiculous.
From the point of view of the West, it is also very interesting that in the financial crisis Russia is saving whole states in order to manage this crisis itself.
In the age of globalisation, the interwoven nature of our economies is far more extensive than we discussed previously in relation to energy.
Colleagues, 25 years ago, almost to the day, President Ronald Reagan addressed this Parliament, on 8 May 1985.
This was the last and so far the only time that a US President has spoken to the democratically elected representatives of the people of Europe.
Your presence in this Chamber today, Mr Vice President, is a symbol of the renewal of that dialogue at the highest level between our two continents.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, with the Convention, the right to protection and recognition of their human dignity and to full participation in society has been secured internationally for disabled persons.
It is now all the more important for the Council to submit the ratification act to the UN no later than this year’s International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent and constructive cooperation throughout the legislative process.
I would also like to thank the French Presidency for the fact that we have now been able to conclude this legislative process with a compromise.
The pre-registration period stipulated in the REACH Regulation began on 1 June 2008 and ended on 1 December 2008, in other words six months later.
In adopting the regulation we had assumed that we would have to reckon on the registration of approximately 200 000 chemical substances.
Almost half of all the pre-registration applications were submitted in the last two weeks of the pre-registration period, that is to say, more than one million in the last two weeks.
We are entering a period of threatened recession, if we are not already in recession.
We need above all, risk protection for ordinary citizens; for, if our plans – and there is no alternative – should fail, it will be above all the ordinary citizens of the European Union, the workers, who have to pay.
This is why we want to establish the same protection for these citizens as we have done for the big banks, by means of more rules, of more supervision, and indeed also of State protection.
This lunchtime we have the opportunity to pass this acid test and make it clear whether, for us, this is about patients’ rights or whether we prefer the blinkered perspective of the national healthcare bureaucracies.
There are a couple of points that we must deal with again when it comes to second reading.
The first is the question of the regulations governing product claims.
We monitor the adaptation to technological change.
I am a member of such a body, as the representative of the Union of European Federalists at Hessian Broadcasting.
Freedom of movement is one of the great achievements of the European Union.
We must also make clear, however – and certain countries with lower standards will soon understand this, as their standards will be raised.
The freedom of movement must not result in a kind of competition becoming the norm that involves dispensing with the social standards that have evolved.
Europe must not stand for the abolition of social and workers’ rights.
For this reason, we should make clear that this has never been our policy, and that it is one that should never be implemented.
We would urge the Council to stop making this House a laughing stock, and the Council should also stop making itself a laughing stock.
It is also important to grant the same rights to citizens throughout the EU.
I would therefore urge you to work on the further development of class actions and common legal entitlements. That would send out a very important signal to citizens.
In my view, assuming that there are good and bad foods is fundamentally the wrong approach.
There are only good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, types of diet.
There are many reasons why people eat the wrong type of diet.
Addressing this problem by attempting to steer consumers in a particular direction with product labelling or even by introducing advertising bans or regulations or applying different VAT rates, will not bring us closer to our desired objective.
We had the disasters.
My fellow Members have also pointed out the disasters of recent times.
We are beholden to people and to the natural environment to ensure that flag States, in particular, fulfil their obligations.
With China we have a factor which is set to use coal for at least 60% of its energy requirements.
As far as further technological developments are concerned, India, South Africa, Australia, America and Russia also want to use these technologies.
That gives Europe an opportunity to invest and further develop this technology for the good of CO2 capture and storage.
Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday, following a brief debate, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed on an approach to what is known as the Schengen evaluation mechanism.
At the same time, the decision has provoked very intense reactions from all the groups in this House.
I have been asked by pretty much all the groups in this House to pay attention to this matter.
As you know, what we are dealing with here is a unilateral change to the legal basis, from Article 77 of the EU Treaty to Article 70.
The subject matter is the exclusion of the European Parliament from further legislative procedures.
For that reason, the Conference of Presidents – acting on behalf of the whole House – has asked the Danish Presidency for a debate at 09.00 tomorrow morning on the legal basis for the Schengen evaluation mechanism.
We here in Parliament also support this step and are waiting for the politicians to take advantage of this opportunity.
Anyone who undermines its ability to function does not want to achieve this objective, whatever they may say.
I can therefore only appeal to all members of parliament in the region to come to their senses once and for all and predicate their policies on the welfare of their citizens.
It is indeed true that, 50 years after the Treaties of Rome were concluded, we have made little progress regarding equality for women in the labour market.
The figures are alarming: 80% of part-time workers are women.
And only 57% of women are in employment, compared with 72% of men.
Wage inequality has also remained stable since 2003.
These are alarming figures, which all of us here lament.
We have also referred to the fact that women are doubly disadvantaged, because this wage inequality is translated into differences in pension rights and social standards.
And we also have a tax and social system that continues to penalise women, in that, for example, unmarried couples and double-income families are still disadvantaged in many tax systems.
Such as in Germany.
I find the behaviour of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in pulling out of the compromise and going through the entire report again, scattering amendments everywhere, distressing and regrettable.
There can be no solution via conventional military action.
In the amendment today, we reversed the reversal of the burden of proof and with it a fundamental element of our state under the rule of law.
Naturally, there is the question of which problems will arise for industry with continued use of REACH.
We will examine this very closely based on analysis of the pre-registrations received.
However, at present it cannot yet be said what exactly this large number really tells us.
We need a bit more time for that.
And I would suggest that I come back either to this House or to the committee to inform you of the result of the analysis and also give you a precise report on the next steps.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will only succeed in fighting climate change and restructuring the world economy if we tackle the two together.
What we need is a green New Deal.
Namely if it is ratified quickly and, most importantly, if the implementation of reforms – especially of the administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the political decision-making processes – takes hold quickly.
I now invite you to take the floor and give your message to the European Parliament.
A very warm welcome to the European Parliament, President Mahmud Abbas.
Much has already been said about this, but I should also like to point out that the rule that consumers must be informed either in the language of their country of residence or in their mother tongue.
It will also ultimately force a significant proportion of disreputable contract models out of the market and thus, in general, put the timeshare market back on a respectable basis, while also ensuring that consumers wishing to buy into holidays in such facilities.
Can do so with complete confidence.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals in the so-called pharmaceutical package which I am presenting this evening at Parliament’s request have a common theme.
The intention of the package is to strengthen the rights, needs and interests of patients in our healthcare systems.
In summary, I believe that we have been presented with a paper that makes important improvements to the Commission document.
A healthy relationship with food and drink is particularly important.
An obsession with being thin is as bad for health as compulsive eating.
People are different, and their individual energy needs differ too, depending on age, gender, occupation, and activity levels.
We do not need new legislation
This year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948.
This declaration presented the first worldwide, formal obligation to protect the dignity of each and every person and the equality of all people, without regard to skin colour, religion or origin.
Article 3 of the declaration states: ‘Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
Would like to point out that the Czech Presidency has not only achieved more than it has been given credit for, but that it was also very varied.
First-rate officials and outstanding ministers, such as Karel Schwarzenberg, Saša Vondra, Ondřej Liška and others, as well as Prime Minister Fischer have done an excellent job.
This country has only one problem and that is President Klaus, who has seriously damaged his country by consciously and deliberately undermining this successful Presidency.
I would like to thank Prime Minister Fischer for the masterful way in which he rejected this, went to the Brussels Summit himself and successfully concluded this Council Presidency.
Despite the fact that we are faced with considerable challenges, we must not lose sight of the interests of the developing countries.
It is with great sadness.
For some of these countries, a free trade agreement of any kind is not the right model and they have an interest in concluding a trade agreement
Perhaps it is true that at that level of development, many countries need to develop an independent economy first. European countries, developed their economies in closed markets.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hardly dare take the floor here any more; given the overall atmosphere here in plenary.
Of course we are all against discrimination, but one dare not question the route we are taking here for fear of being pushed into a corner.
The current Treaties grant scarcely any major competences to Parliament in the area of international trade agreements, with the exception of those agreements falling under Article 300(3)(2).
The establishment of a specific institutional framework such as this is the most frequent basis for application of this Treaty provision.
And it also provides the justification for applying the assent procedure when concluding Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and the ACP countries and possible agreements with Korea or India and South-East Asia – which, in turn, is of particular importance in the fight against deforestation.
The Mediterranean diet still consists of high-fibre bread, large amounts of fruit and vegetables and wine too.
It has been scientifically proven – this conclusion was reached in a September 2008 edition – that the Mediterranean diet helps to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Type 2 diabetes
To decrease the effects of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. This is illustrated by a visit to graveyards in Crete, the island my father hails from: seeing the age people live to there really brings this home to you.
Above all, we need to restore confidence in a free and open market.
However, the international markets will not stop and wait for decisions in Europe, and nor will they wait for Parliament to make its pronouncements.
For that reason, the open declaration that we will be adopting here tomorrow represents a further opportunity not to increase the focus against criminal efforts but to increase the frequency of inspections.
Risks, furthermore, must not be determined merely in terms of which plants are involved but also in relation to who on earth is running these plants and from what murky sources this oil is obtained.
The institutions thus need to be aware, in relation to inspections, that they represent a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, I am very pleased that, in the closing stages of this Temporary Committee, this issue has been met with such strong interest.
I would also like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate and all those who have worked with us.
We have produced a roadmap to take us to Copenhagen, which naturally contains signposts as well as stop signs and unrestricted travel signs.
I also hope that, in the spirit of the compromise – I am much obliged to Mr Demetriou in this regard – we shall yet succeed in convincing Mr Casini.
A basis for this is also found in Amendment 38, where we make clear once more – even though this is already stated in the text – that, naturally, only law that is really in keeping with the principles of the European Union and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be applied in the Member States, as that goes without saying as far as we are concerned.
No court in the Union would apply in any way law that was not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in ruling that patients have a right to be reimbursed the costs of treatment carried out abroad, the European Court of Justice has given us a clear mission.
The report by the local correspondent of the newspaper made very worthwhile reading.
His article shows the interaction between official and unofficial troops, which is to say that calling for the re-supply of MONUC alone is pointless, as what is really needed is to get to grips with the causes of the conflict.
Mr President, I wanted to speak again because a number of my fellow Members have spoken about the jobs issue in perhaps somewhat sanctimonious terms.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
In the context of the Doha Round, it would interest me to know how the Directorate-General for Trade intends to safeguard the tariff quota that underpins the competitiveness of the European fermentation industry.
The tariff quota serves a very important function, because the fermentation industry must remain internationally competitive.
There must be no repeats of the shipping accidents involving the and the .
However, I think it is a shame that we have excluded large areas of science.
Studies and scientists that approach the subject of climate change with less gloomy scenarios or perhaps even positively, have simply been ignored.
Corresponding applications were rejected by the majority, and that was that.
We should hear calls for another delay.
We are thus against deferral.
Mr Mitchell, with respect to the issue of lifts, which you have raised, I would like to reveal something which may be a secret part of the Bureau’s debates.
At the most recent Bureau meeting, I criticised the situation you have just described and which, shamefully, is not merely a problem in Strasbourg.
In Brussels, too, there have been weeks during which it really was impossible to move around the various labyrinthine Parliament buildings, because the lifts were out of order.
The basic precondition for this, however, is to be talking with Hamas, that those amongst the Palestinian people who want to talk with Hamas be supported.
As a side point, if it is true that 163 hectares have now been re-released for settlement.
Before giving the floor to Mr Chastel, I will read an excerpt from a letter addressed to MEPs by the children of Sakineh. This was sent to me through AKI International specifically to coincide with the debate on the World day against the death penalty.
Colleagues, let me introduce, in a few words, our Lex signing of the Financial Supervisory Package.
This package will constitute our financial supervisory activities adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can hold this debate on basic principles. I am talking about what is referred to as the list of terrorist organisations.
Since the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, we know that the legal assessment is perfectly clear.
The system of lists of terrorist organisations of both the EU and the UN violates citizens’ fundamental rights.
Aside from this, however, the Commission is working and will continue to work day to day to ensure that citizens are indeed able to exercise their civil rights.
In a large number of areas where your report, Mrs Gacek, calls on the Commission to act, the Commission is already taking action to ensure that these rights are reinforced and extended.
I should like to give the example of the Commission Action Plan on consular protection.
I would add that I fully agree with you that this is an area in which something needs to be done.
After all, just a few weeks ago, we held an extremely instructive debate on the subject in this House that showed the extent of the gulf between aspiration and reality in the very case of consular rights.
The fight against terror, against organised crime and against illegal immigration is certainly an important concern for Europe.
It must be said, however, that the Stockholm Programme, regrettably, is a consistent continuation of the path of constant degradation of and interference with guaranteed human rights, civil rights and freedoms that we have been pursuing since September 11, 2001.
When I was a young lad and entering politics, I was told that one does not talk to terrorists.
A couple of years later I saw pictures on television of this terrorist leader receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.
What was possible then can be possible also in future.
Therefore, one question is whether progress is made to the extent that the available mechanisms produce the necessary dialogue.
On behalf of my group, I should like to thank all those, including from other groups, who worked on our resolution.
If this resolution can help improve the atmosphere, we shall have made a contribution, however small, to ending loss of life that is intolerable to all.
I would, however, just like to add that we have no intention of weakening or postponing the environmental objectives for the car industry.
We will still insist on these environmental objectives being implemented and pushed through, but at the same time we should also have the opportunity here to discuss the car industry’s economic difficulties with a representative of the Commission.
That is one of our concerns, and I hope that we will gain wide support for it.
The clear-cut committee vote and a successful trialogue prove that coherent legislation has been achieved.
In the minutes that remain, I would like to present this legislative project once again in connection with two important issues.
We have been able to ensure that, in the future, this regulation will enable Eurostat to gain faster, unrestricted access to all the statistical data which is required to collect important economic criteria.
In this way, we will provide a bit more transparency for statistics at European level and therefore make the euro area that bit more competitive.
This is good news, particularly in the light of the financial crisis and the difficult discussions concerning the statistical system.
What human rights organisations in both Colombo and Jaffna told me at the time is unfortunately confirmed time and again: ‘war is an institution’.
There are refugees in their thousands. There is a lack of medical care and of food.
Aid agencies must be given unrestricted access to the civilian population in a cease-fire to be agreed.
The government has set up corridors to facilitate the evacuation of civilians from the combat areas.
Tamil Tigers have failed to respect this safe zone, are continuing to fire and are using people as human shields.
I understood that the crisis was caused by the socialists in Europe.
Of course, we already knew that. It is a well-known principle in Germany.
When the sun shines in the morning, the Christian democrats are responsible, but if there is ice and snow, that is the fault of the social democrats.
However, you, Mr Lehne, have said when you attacked me for saying something wrong – I may have been mistaken.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Grossetête.
I also wish to thank the Commissioner for his speech, particularly the aspect of piracy and counterfeiting.
We are preparing an e-mail for all Members. The technical details will be set out in that e-mail in the appropriate languages.
There was no need to admonish us to tell the truth.
We are always bound by honesty in all matters, including this one.
Before I give you the floor, Commissioner, let me first extend a welcome on behalf of this House to the members of a delegation from the People’s Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery above.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate is indeed taking place, if somewhat by chance, at exactly the right time.
My report to all intents and purposes addresses the other side of the coin.
‘Europe without Barriers’ is a good motto, as it goes to the heart of the European idea – bringing people together.
I also hope, however, that it proves possible to break down the barriers in the minds of some people, who still have political, if not ideological reservations about the European Union, and therefore close their minds to its further development as envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon.
There is a good deal more work to do on this in your country, too.
I am just preparing an e-mail to all Members, which I will sign in person.
Some of us have not even reached Strasbourg and also want to have this information.
The e-mail will be sent at around 11.00.
I am very glad to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Roland Dumas.
We are very glad to see you.
The Blue Card and the standardised residence and work permit regulations represent precisely the tool which will allow Member States to react and to bring highly qualified workers into the country just when they need them.
We are also putting in place standardised rules for issuing the Blue Card.
I am pleased that the Council has included my proposal in the implementing rules to label the Blue Card with the symbol of the state which issued the card.
This means that for Austria, there will be a red, white and red Blue Card and the other states will have a similar solution.
It would interest me to find out whether there is an initiative in ECOFIN and on the part of Commissioner Kovács to initiate a progressive tax write-off across Europe for those energy projects that are currently imminent, such as the Nabucco pipeline or the building of new power stations, in order to create incentives and thus drive these strategic initiatives forward.
In July this year, I asked the Council about the status of this procedure.
It informed me that, unlike Parliament, it saw no need for an initiative at the current time.
In view of the fact that a former French Commissioner and minister stressed the need for revision in his report, I find the Council’s attitude incomprehensible.
I therefore could not ask for a better committee chairman than Mr Galeote, who is not prepared to accept Parliament decisions being disregarded.
I would like to thank him quite specifically for that.
I would call on the French Presidency, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider their attitude towards the citizens of Europe.
In the European Parliament you have a reliable partner alongside you as you undertake the necessary implementation of your ambitious reform programme.
However, this Parliament will also fight to secure the funds that the European Union needs to keep the promises it has made to countries such as Haiti. The fight to achieve an ambitious European budget is therefore also a fight to be able to guarantee that we can keep our promises in the area of solidarity.
The report also explicitly welcomes the Commission’s proposal for a horizontal directive covering all forms of discrimination.
I welcome today’s debate.
Consistent rehabilitation and the publicising of crimes are the only way to come to terms with the past.
Opening up archives is a first, important step in the right direction.
This applies not only to Ukraine, but to all other countries which lived under Soviet communist rule and, of course, to Russia itself.
In recent weeks, we have seen the start of a difficult period throughout the world, in particular in relation to the financial crisis and its drastic effects on the world economy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, debates of the kind we are holding today are very difficult for us all.
The reason they are difficult is that Israel is a friend, that many of us – and this is particularly true of me – feel bound to the country by ties of deep friendship.
I think that, particularly in a financial and energy crisis, it is incumbent on us to take an even greater interest in this field and also to respond to the wishes and needs of the population in this regard, because, ultimately, man and nature are not in opposition, but should complement one another.
From this point of view, I think we can point to some pleasing successes, particularly in energy policy, and perhaps we will be able to intensify cooperation in this field.
The problems that have arisen as a result of our defining agriculture as merely an economic field and equating things we should possibly be regarding as different.
We have also brought about a situation through this regulation whereby tyres will produce considerably less noise.
This does involve some costs, it is true.
And for that reason, we thought it was particularly important to include text in the regulation stating that the reduction in noise emissions by road traffic cannot be solely down to tyre manufacturers and, indirectly, consumers.
And I am extremely grateful that the Council did, in the end, adopt this stipulation.
Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Borloo.
You will be combating unemployment and poverty in the coming months and years.
We therefore require a sensible package.
We do not need free allocation up to 100% in the industry affected by carbon leakage, we need 100% allocation, and we need benchmarks.
For those businesses not at risk from carbon leakage, I believe the 20/20 solution is the best so that we can start with 20% increases.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, climate protection is the aim of us all.
There are different methods, however, and they are not always recognisable at first glance.
I have no objections to green procurement in cases where it makes sense.
I reject this directive, anyway.
It will change little in terms of the overall outcome in Parliament.
Mr Secretary-General, distinguished guests.
It is a great honour for us to welcome to the European Parliament, on his first official visit, His Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr Ban Ki-moon.
Swift is really not the word we can use.
I need only remind you of Enron and Parmalat.
At the time, the European Parliament had adopted a relevant report by Mr Katiforis – I was the shadow rapporteur – on the issue of credit rating agencies. That was back in 2003.
Now, in October 2008, the Commission may well present proposals, but the IOSCO is already saying that we should not deviate from the Securities and Exchange Commission and US rules, for otherwise the international financial system will be disrupted.
Thank you, Commissioner, that was a very important discussion between the Commission and Parliament.
The two institutions would like to back each other, to have a similar approach to the Multiannual Financial Framework.
We will see the European Commission project at the end of this month, when it will be also be presented in Parliament.
I would like to take the opportunity to urge our Slovene Members, for whom and for whose country I have the greatest sympathy, to find a way once again of continuing Slovenia’s great achievements towards European integration.
This country was the first new Member State to introduce the euro and was the first to implement Schengen.
Slovenia is a pioneer of European unification. I would like to see Slovenia, in its national interest, also act as a pioneer in connection with the accession of Croatia to the EU.
We believe that you and your country will continue to play a crucial role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion.
The significance of milk production, particularly in mountainous areas where grassland farming is often the only option, has already been discussed. In this case we are preserving jobs, not just the environment, something equally important in my opinion.
I believe that preparing for the soft landing following 2015 is an important issue.
At present I oppose a general increase in the milk quota.
I believe that we should be cautious at a time when we have this high milk surplus.
A dairy farmer receives less than 30% of the sale price, while the sale price in the supermarkets – even in my own Member State – is currently the same as it was 25 years ago.
Madam President, the meat scandal in Ireland has made waves throughout Europe, Irish meat was sold as Tyrolean bacon.
The only solution to this EU-wide problem is a compulsory declaration for fresh meat and meat products, if the meat comes from outside the EU.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a shame that Mrs Harms is no longer present.
After such an unorthodox attack – one which was pushing the limits of defamation – it would have been right to have allowed me the opportunity to answer her.
I will now do so in writing.
However, on behalf of the Commission, I reject in the most definite possible terms Mrs Harms’s claims in both style and substance.
Our citizens are intelligent adults who can think for themselves.
Traffic-light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isolation, so it confuses consumers.
What should I choose if a product label shows that a specific food has red, yellow and green nutritional elements?
The food industry will drive up prices even further.
I would like to draw your attention to statistics produced by the European Medicines Agency which has been investigating the possible effects of improved patient information.
In Great Britain, 5% of all the people who are admitted to hospital are there because they have taken the wrong medicine.
5% have been hospitalised because they have taken the wrong medicine.
We know that in 50% of these cases this could have been avoided if the patient had been informed about the nature of the medicine they received.
I also use this argument in reply to healthcare authorities in the Member States who are not enthusiastic about the prospect of well-informed patients because they believe that well-informed patients are demanding and will ask for more expensive drugs.
Firstly, faith in so-called smart technology easily tempts people into handing their responsibility over to machines and instruments.
But they can only be worked out by local players, because only they know what is needed.
This final report exposes serious cases of corruption involving EU funds.
Must the workers at the Polish shipyards be punished because certain authorities, or the government, have not done their job?
Now is the time to finally put an end to nuclear weapons on this planet, especially Article 6.
The new US President, Barack Obama, has stated that he wants nuclear disarmament.
Mr President, because we have now arrived at compromises, which – as Mr Schwab has just said – have removed the teeth from this legislative text, the question arises as to what is the point of this directive.
We must continue to oppose capital punishment resolutely, and to speak out about instances of its use everywhere in the world.
We are disturbed by recent events in China, where 12 people have been sentenced to death following the ethnic disturbances and violence in Urumchi in Xinjiang Province.
Despite the serious crimes which were committed during the disturbances in June, we call upon the Chinese authorities to maintain the standards of honest trial proceedings.
We are also disturbed by cases of the pronouncement and carrying out of the death penalty in the United States.
Especially in the State of Ohio, where, after several unsuccessful attempts, executions by lethal injection have been postponed.
I also have a brief statement to make on yesterday’s International Women’s Day.
I would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009.
Sergey Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva and all other defenders of human rights in Russia whom it represents.
We have awarded this year’s prize to Memorial. We sincerely hope that by doing so, we will contribute to ending the circle of fear, uncertainty and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation.
We have discussed the matter with Vice-President Wallström.
On the one hand, we know the Commission is trying to give us answers that are as full as we would like them to be, but then that obviously curtails the number of Members able to participate.
Thank you all, and I am sure that you will receive full answers in writing.
Patients are responsible citizens whose health is their most important asset and who are entitled to have the best and safest treatments and medicines at their disposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India Summit marks a new stage in the deepening of relations between the European Union and India.
We want to promote economic development in India.
Today we commemorate the sixth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism.
Japan was devastated by a triple disaster:
First, an enormous earthquake, measuring nine on the Richter scale, rocked the country.
Then, a tsunami with 20-metre-high waves laid waste to a 400-kilometre-long coastal strip.
The next day, the first of three reactor blocks at the Fukushima Daiichi power station exploded.
A nuclear meltdown occurred – the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
The regulation that we are passing today is environmentally friendly since, as part of the CO2 package, it represents an important contribution, on the part of European policy, to the reduction in CO2 emissions from motor vehicles.
At the same time, however – and I would call this clever environmental policy – it also helps consumers – drivers – to pay less while, at the same time, acting in an environmentally-friendly manner, as it leads to considerable savings, not only in terms of CO2, but also in terms of the consumption of petrol and diesel.
In addition, it also – and this, too, is an important point that was particularly important to Parliament and its Members – leads to improvements in the safety of European roads, and not only in relation to goods vehicles, but in relation to cars as well.
In the case of legislative proposals pending as at 1 December 2009, the date on which the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the President of the Commission has invited the parliamentary committees to which proposals have already been submitted in the current legislative term, as recorded in the minutes of the part-sessions, to verify the legal bases and procedural modifications proposed by the Commission, along with any other amendments to be made in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and to decide whether they intend to adjudge positions already adopted under the consultation procedure to be ordinary legislative procedure first readings or to constitute approvals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Allow me to express my pleasure at the fact that the Commissioner is also dealing with this issue, and I hope this will be reflected not only in his brief address but also in the work of the Commission, because we naturally have a duty to ensure that the actions of the European Commission duly reflect our wishes and ideas.
Where is Mrs Kroes?
Instead of thinking about whether Ireland can allocate 200% of its domestic product as guarantees exclusively for Irish citizens and for future loans.
Let us support the living civil society or even lawyers like Shirin Ebadi, for example, who is standing up for the Bahai detainees there.
The option we have is for the Commission to say that there will be State aid, but that, within the framework of this State aid, we want these workplaces to be modernised from an environmental point of view, so as to guarantee the long-term future of the sites and to ensure that workers have good long-term jobs there.
The preparations for the first reading of our budget, during which we had to read, understand and evaluate 1 400 amendments, were greatly affected by the financial crisis.
In so doing, we were basically already anticipating the Council’s reaction to our budgetary requests.
President Saakashvili, your message today was very important for all of us, but it was very important as well for the future OSCE summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, in one week’s time on 1 and 2 December.
First of all, it was of crucial importance to the whole of your region, to the Caucasus, both the southern Caucasus and the northern Caucasus. We have always known that you are brave men. Courage and prudence should always go together.
I voted in favour of this report, quite simply because we have to take every measure to ensure that cross-border police and judicial cooperation is organised efficiently.
We have to ensure that there are uniform standards across Europe for this.
However, the Commission will continue to pay particular attention to the dissemination of information on the Directive, will distribute updated, simplified guidance to EU citizens and will use the Internet to disseminate information.
It will also call on and help Member States to inform citizens about their rights by means of awareness-raising campaigns.
The free movement of persons is one of the most fundamental freedoms of the European internal market.
This freedom lies behind the functioning of the internal market and thus also behind the competitiveness of the European economy.
We must recognise quite clearly that shortcomings in the implementation of Community law in this field are indeed contrary to the fundamental principles constituting the foundation of Europe.
A great many of the measures necessary to this end are ones on which we have competence and are able to give advice.
One among very many issues is undoubtedly patient information and the safety of medicinal products.
Patients are entitled to be fully informed about their illness.
And, if they are fully informed and able to act on a par with medical practitioners, they must be entitled to safe medicinal products and safe treatment methods.
In the parliamentary working group on Quality of childhood, we observed that our children live in a very complicated world.
The future for those who are children right here, right now – today – is completely uncertain.
They can follow a similar life path to their parents or do the exact opposite.
They can marry someone from the opposite sex or someone of their own sex.
When we launched the project of uniting Europe, all that was completely different.
The new directive also has the lowest limit values for toxic substances like lead and mercury that apply worldwide.
We can make it quite clear that it is our duty to work to ensure that Vietnam becomes an equal partner, that it opens up, and that it draws nearer to us.
This must not, however, be at the expense of fundamental human rights, but must be based on a fair partnership founded on fundamental human rights.
Risk reduction is the primary objective.
The use of the general basic principles of integrated plant protection will become mandatory for the entire European Union from 2014.
Compliance with the stipulations of the Water Framework Directive is top priority.
The Member States will establish buffer zones adjacent to bodies of water, which must be adapted to the conditions of the soil properties and geographical circumstances.
There are regulations for checking equipment and regular maintenance intervals will be set. Risk reduction means that professional users must obtain sound and ongoing training in the use of plant protection products.
Private users, who have no specific training and can cause damage in private gardens through incorrect usage, must be informed by well-trained salespersons on the use and risks when purchasing plant protection products.
We are deciding today on a compromise with regard to an object of trade, the previous market for which was limited to just a few Member States.
It has been a really interesting experience for me just to see fundamental advocates of the internal market and competition suddenly pulling out all the stops to continue to be able to utilise national decision-making and isolation mechanisms.
The important thing now is that we do not limit this intercultural dialogue to 2008, but continue it in the next few years and beyond.
The proposed measures will benefit the environment, consumers and users.
Identical conditions throughout the European Union will guarantee identical safety standards and identical production conditions. Substances that are proven to be detrimental to health will not be licensed, on that we are in agreement.
However, a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas.
Exposure must also be taken into consideration because with pesticides, like many things in life, it is the dosage that creates the poison hazard.
A headache tablet is a blessing, but if you take 20 it becomes dangerous, even life-threatening.
Such a government to observe the fundamental principles of the peace process, to refrain from violence and to conduct peace negotiations with Israel with commitment.
The European Union is prepared to work together with such a government.
Madam President, Commissioner. Piebalgs should really answer that question, but I will pass it on to him.
A roaming system for oil products: that would be quite something!
There is therefore a need to ensure that the data collected is not abused.
Ultimately, this is about the key fundamental right of every EU citizen to have his or her privacy protected, and in this context we must observe the fact that freedom means freedom from the State and not freedom through the State.
It is now time, however, particularly following the very welcome meeting between the two prime ministers, Mr Fico and Mr Gyurcsány, to arrange matters so that the two countries can resolve their problems together in peace, and not give radicals a platform.
The radicals must not be allowed to continue spreading poison.
That certainly applies to Mr Slota’s verbal radicalism, but it also applies particularly to the Hungarian Guard.
I call on both countries and both prime ministers, and all parties in this House, to make every effort to silence the radicals.
My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, rejects the resolution that has been tabled on Kosovo.
My group insists that all the regulations concerning Kosovo must be in line with international law and must be agreed with all the parties involved, including Serbia.
The recognition of Kosovo has created a disastrous precedent, which is now being followed by other regions, such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Madam President, Mr Kindermann has submitted a constructive resolution for the cormorant problem, for which I have gladly voted.
I am pleased that this resolution has received 558 votes.
The cormorant was put under protection a long time ago, when there were only a few breeding colonies left in Europe.
In the meantime, it has become so prevalent that whole ponds and rivers are being eaten bare. It therefore needs to be included in Annex II of the Birds Directive. The damage it causes is jeopardising the existence of many fish farmers and fishermen.
If the Commission does not act, stocks of fish species will be endangered.
There are three major demonstration projects in the world which have other targets, that is to say, to accelerate oil and gas production.
However, we need our European demonstration plants because we are responsible for mines, for technology, but also for the regulatory framework for the time after the closure of mines.
This concerned a point of order under the terms of Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure which allows the agenda to be changed.
I regret that I can now only permit points of order.
We will not be restarting this debate. I would like to point out that I will immediately cut off any speaker who attempts to begin the debate again.
My aim was to produce a report which provides a description of the developments over the next 30 to 40 years for all decision makers and interested parties and which offers food for thought and recommendations for action for the individual areas of social policy.
Social security and pension systems in the Member States have traditionally been designed, developed and financed in very different ways, which is why it will not be possible to harmonise them at an EU level.
Some examples of your work demonstrate your ability to act, but also your sensitivity towards the general public in Europe, both in relation to the European Working Time Directive and the internal organisation of the European Parliament.
Of course, it is not always easy for you to find the right words. However, weak points must be exposed by the Ombudsman with a certain amount of advance notice and appropriate restraint. In the end, it is all about us working together to serve the citizens of Europe.
You have made a very positive contribution towards this over the past year, Mr Diamandouros.
Mr President, my thanks go to Carlos Coelho, together with my congratulations on his report.
We would have all been disappointed if his report had been below par, because we are already used to this standard of report from him.
Carlos Coelho clearly pointed out from the beginning that his report was about the security of children.
We can achieve this by issuing secure passports and by taking fingerprints to ensure that it is possible to check if the person crossing the border is actually the person shown in the passport.
Mr President, the European Security and Defence Policy is not, at present, a navy, but it is a ship of war in international politics.
The European Parliament seems happy to apply the motto ‘everything that is not on our radar screen does not exist in reality, either’.
The main objective is bureaucracy reduction, in the interests of simple, fast procedures for the authorisation of cross-border regular services.
I very much welcome the introduction of the revised 12-day rule for organised cross-border coach journeys.
That make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers.
Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy.
At the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars.
Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to Mrs Corbey’s comments, I would like to say first of all that I gave the go-ahead for a European database of prescription-only medicines several years ago.
Work on the database is going well and it will be available in the foreseeable future.
I spent two days last week on the Gaza Strip border and observed a great deal of the suffering of the people on both sides.
I believe that a ceasefire alone will not be enough.
The ceasefire must be linked to a cessation of weapons smuggling into Gaza in the future.
Therefore, I am in favour of the retention of the resolution from the Conference of Presidents.
It was unacceptable that large banks were unable to foresee the demise of their own institution and for small depositors to go down with them.
I wish to draw attention to something that particularly besmirches this House: the pension fund.
Vice President Biden has been a key figure in American politics and a friend to colleagues in this Chamber for many years.
He was first elected to the US Senate in 1972, serving as one of the youngest senators in his country’s history.
He was elected six times before becoming Vice President of the United States in November 2008.
Further nationalistic or even separatist trends with which officials defend their position and under which the people suffer.
It is quite clear that the State of Israel has a right to defend itself. It is entitled to defend itself against people whose aim it is to destroy the State.
Yet a democratic country based on the rule of law must always ask itself whether the means it uses to do so are proportionate.
In my estimation – and, I believe, that of most of my fellow Members in this House – the means are not proportionate.
Service-providing enterprises are there for the users of these services and not primarily for the service providers themselves.
In this light, it is important that we lay down the appropriate rules for the users of all means of transportation and ensure that the services they are using are also of suitable quality.
In this context – and here I am only taking up something that is mentioned time and again – it is very important.
We look after the rights of persons with reduced mobility in particular.
Let me tell you, it is not only those with a disabled persons’ identity card who are incapacitated.
Parents – adults with young children – certainly also need support from our rules on all our modes of transport.
I hope that this also gains acceptance in one form or another.
But this is not a matter of liking or disliking;
It is a matter of solutions.
Therefore, we must return to dialogue and talks, as many of our fellow Members have already said today.
Also, the people in Gaza must be given the chance to live half-decent lives.
Why are they voting for Hamas?
The answer is that they see them as the only chance, the last chance, of even surviving.
We must give these people an economic basis for survival, too; we must lift the boycott and end their isolation.
We heard all about it in Monday's debate.
I almost have the impression that we should be handing out membership forms for the Social Democratic Party to the PPE-DE Group.
They cannot change their opinions fast enough.
In March 2007 it supported the Commission's proposal that all partner countries should always be enabled to participate in certain Community programmes.
I am pointing this out now because it is, of course, right to learn from experiences such as this.
The Commission takes the view that there is still much work to be done to ensure that the citizens of the European Union are able to claim – to the full and in real life – the right guaranteed them under Article 20 of the EC Treaty.
The citizens expect the European Union to provide added value in their protection in a third country.
Protection provided by diplomatic and consular missions is not, at the end of the day, limited to crisis situations, but also covers the provision of assistance in everyday situations.
This package contains very up-to-date and progressive proposals.
I hope that I will have the support of the European Parliament for this package.
What I would propose would be to be active in this area, on the one hand in the area of tax relief and, on the other, in the area of assistance.
A huge amount could be achieved in this area.
And I would propose that we embark on a new initiative in this connection.
In order to retain this clarity in Mrs Bauer’s report, to withdraw its deleting amendments, which would further water down the report.
Madam President, Commissioner, the harbingers of the crisis in the motor industry, such as the first falls in orders, were probably not taken seriously enough.
At first we perhaps hoped it would just be gas-guzzling American cars that would be affected.
Anyone who has spoken a little to car dealers knows diesel vehicles have been hard to shift in the EU, too, for months now.
My colleague Claudio Fava will speak on behalf of our group on questions relating to the CIA flights and that part of the discussion.
I will focus on the issues relating to the closure of the Guantánamo camp and I will begin by responding to Hartmut Nassauer.
Existing water shortages are often exacerbated by poor decisions – as in Cyprus, where citizens are paying the price in the form of water rationing for the building of new golf courses despite chronic water shortages.
I would like to offer my thanks for the constructive contributions that I have heard Members make to the debate today.
This applies not only to consumers but also to small enterprises and tradespeople.
Our aim, Commissioner, should perhaps be to put these two directives together in the medium term because very many small businesses are confronted by the same irritations in the internal market as consumers.
We know of many examples, such as annoying advertising and misleading and aggressive business practices.
We all know the address book fraud.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a journalist, I would like to draw attention to a change in this directive that is of great concern to me personally.
When the directive has not yet been transposed in 10 out of 27 Member States, we are going a step further and trying to stick an additional directive.
But what really disturbs me, as a journalist, is the fact that it is damaging the freedom of the press in the Member States.
Limit the freedom of the press if a publisher is required to accept an advertisement from neo-Nazis or anti-Semites.
In my homeland, we see neo-Nazis trying to buy property almost on a weekly basis.
If property is being rented or sold, we cannot prevent left-wing or right-wing extremists from taking it.
They will make use of this new amendment, and I object strongly to this and will vote against it. I am therefore in favour of supporting referral back to committee or, if this is impossible, of voting against it.
I shall confine myself here to one social policy aspect: the prosperity of the so-called First World, over-production and excessive consumption.
– especially transport with massive use of fossil fuels – are the main causes of the increase in climate-damaging greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, it is the socially weakest and the poor who are most affected by the consequences of the climate disaster waiting in the wings.
They do not have the means to adapt.
Energy and food prices hit them much, much harder than they do the rich.
Famines which already exist will worsen drastically.
Petitions sometimes relate to aims that the European Union proclaims but does not subsequently pursue.
The thrust of this petition is that people should not be required to buy one particular computer program so that they can watch the material transmitted from the European Parliament and respond in the only permissible format. Open Parliament means open standards.
We have an obligation here, and we must act on it.
You all know Mr Lambrinidis as not just someone who ran votes efficiently in this House.
With his experience, his training as a lawyer, his wide-ranging knowledge and his winning personality, he is the right man for the job.
I would like to thank you all for expressing, through your applause, the fact that Mr Lambrinidis can count on the support of the Members of this House.
Madam President, we find the Czech Presidency’s attempts to water down the EU’s childcare objectives to be truly shameful and we naturally, therefore, roundly reject them.
The Council and the European Commission have just made certain declarations in relation to our expectations of the negotiation mandate and about keeping Parliament informed.
That is the situation as I understand it at this point, and that is also how it will appear in the minutes.
Can we agree, then, Commissioner, that, when the Council of Ministers fails to come out in favour of a clear ring-fencing of the revenue from the Eurovignettes, you will withdraw the proposal?
You see, you said you do not want any new taxes.
I completely agree with you that if the Eurovignette is to be made more expensive as a result of exhaust emissions and noise, this extra money must also be used to reduce the environmental impact of road transport and not to fill holes in the finance ministers’ budgets.
With that in mind, I hope that you will stick to your position.
No taxation without ring-fencing and withdrawal of the proposal where that is the case.
Both these countries have achieved great success in the Union.
This is with a national supervisory authority acting as the control body.
The European Union has had six months of drama, dynamism and declarations under President Sarkozy.
I hope that yours will be a constructive, productive Council Presidency, as the EU faces immense challenges.
You yourself mentioned the war between Israel and Hamas and the economic crisis, and of course there are also internal issues such as the Treaty of Lisbon.
Nevertheless, there is still the risk of zero weighting.
However, Mr Lehne, we do have to consider how to move on in relation to this matter.
I will therefore make the following observations: what we were going to vote on tomorrow was an agreement at first reading reached between the rapporteur and the Council.
On 2 December 2011, the Council informed Mr Lehne, in a formal letter, that it had unanimously adopted the text in Coreper that we were aiming to decide on tomorrow here in Parliament.
I, personally – along with the majority of my group – voted ‘no’.
I will mention two examples, from experience in my Franconian home.
I know of the efforts of political extremists, neo-Nazis and left-wing radicals attempting to acquire property.
Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on your behalf, welcome to the European Parliament all our honoured guests.
Many of us remember – some of us who are very young.
Italy has taken a lead in this area, as has Sweden, though perhaps not quite as impressively as Italy.
This is how tax incentives can be used to get new models onto the streets.
We have listened very attentively to what Mr Radwan has to say.
The Bavarian election campaign casts a long shadow.
Yes, some of what you say is absolutely right.
But the US taxpayer is footing the bill.
It is also important that we are opening up to the Balkan states.
You attached very great importance to enlargement of the Union to include the Western Balkans.
There are indeed many problems to be solved there.
The countries concerned have to prepare first, but after that, their participation in the European Union will help us, too, to solve many problems.
All the problems we are now facing involve a tsunami.
This is man-made.
Why, in spite of corresponding warnings, was action not taken.
Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz addressed all these points.
Mr President, the attraction for researchers naturally also depends on the net income that they receive.
Are we working together with Commissioner Kovács to develop a proposal which will allow researchers to pay no tax on their earnings and which will ensure that donations to research organisations are also tax-free?
A system of this kind is already in place in the United States.
Would it not be possible to carry out a comparative study so that we can also provide incentives in this area?
You quoted my friend Mr Daul who said here that the financial crisis did not represent the defeat of capitalism.
It is true that it has not defeated capitalism – unfortunately that still exists.
But it has defeated the capitalists who told us for years that we had no need of rules, as the market would regulate itself, would regulate things itself.
These capitalists have suffered a defeat, and when you – having up to now indulged in policies similar to those of the people.
They said we had no need of rules.
You tell the House that we need a Europe of rules. I can only agree: we do indeed need more rules to manage, to overcome the financial crisis.
I should like to wish you a warm welcome to the club of regulators in Europe – it seems that you, too, have learned your lesson.
We need a different basis on which to calculate the number of corridors.
Parliament has proposed one per country.
I think that we in Germany would need a north/south and an east/west corridor.
Secondly, we need to consider if alternate corridors are possible in areas which possibly have less mixed traffic.
Thirdly, it must be clear that the overall capacity of rail transport must not be reduced.
Who attempt to restore the balance and to pursue precisely this dual strategy: major criticism of Russia, but also a willingness to enter into partnership with Russia.
One of the major risks is that this will degenerate into a routine, that no one will take us seriously any more.
The results which we present will not be taken seriously either.
The Court of Auditors' Report is an interesting report – the name and shame principle has proved its worth.
I am also pleased that we have succeeded in including animal protection in this regulation and that we were able to establish more transparency.
I would have expected more courage from the Commission.
I hope that we will have more access to the application protocols and be able to introduce an electronic field pass.
It is not only a milestone for environmental and consumer protection in Europe.
It is a magic moment for Europe because this decision to phase out highly toxic pesticides is unprecedented and it is unique worldwide.
In the last phase of pre-registration the agency set up an additional, rapid telephone answering service for help with any problems.
I will say this again: the decision is very important.
Because we realise the resolution is needed quickly.
But we need a resolution which has strong support, and these matters are of great importance.
At that time, defence of the status quo was the Soviet Union’s primary objective, while for Russia today the primary objective is to change the status quo to its own advantage.
It has an objective interest in frozen conflicts and in criticism of the Charter of Paris through recognition of Abkhasia and South Ossetia.
It is interested in an unstable Ukraine.
Mr President, I very much welcome the central element of the Krahmer report, the European safety network.
There is, then, a rough framework, so that everything moves flexibly and so that there is a level playing field.
For this reason, it is essential that we begin to plan straight away how we can bring stability back to this country at the heart of Africa with all the peaceful and, if necessary, military means at our disposal, or even using peacekeeping troops.
We have not reached this point yet, but we must discuss it.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Presidency, but also the Commission, for their very clear statements on this situation.
Mr President, I can support this resolution from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because it includes my specific proposals to combat black market labour and particularly undeclared work.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mr Watson and I, Mr Pöttering and Mr Crowley took part in a meeting in the castle in Prague.
To that end, it is also important – for example, in our analyses of what is needed – to focus more strongly on what we should be doing.
For example, a consumer scoreboard is a very important instrument which must be further expanded so that we can take better account of citizens' concerns and interests in this area.
What is Europe doing?
I think Europe's approach has been far too wishy-washy to achieve certain things.
I would like to see the Council and Commission being far more robust and resolute in pursuing diversification for Europe, as this is also important for our energy supply.
A particular concern for our group, however, is the issue of energy poverty.
And what we are doing to address it, for this is still a very serious problem in Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a dramatic situation, as we know.
The actions of Russia and Ukraine are irresponsible.
It must also be said that the Commission is blameworthy in that we were relatively slow to take action.
Although it is also true that Commissioner Piebalgs has addressed this issue excellently over the past few days.
The team of experts was a splendid idea.
And I think he deserves thanks for the events of recent days.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the broad support for European space policy demonstrated by this debate.
I would very much like this broad support to be shown during the process of creating the financial foundations for a permanent and lasting European presence in space.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors are not sitting back and doing nothing.
Other regions in the world are already far ahead of us when it comes to the vision of what should be done next.
If we cannot identify new projects and develop new technologies, we will not be able to retain our leading position in the field of space-based applications, because we will simply not have the necessary foundations in science and research.
Health is one of our most important assets, if not the most important.
The significance of health will continue to increase in our aging society.
In a democratic society, it therefore goes without saying that patients must be provided with comprehensive information about matters which affect their health.
We will pass it on.
The apologies of the French Presidency were given in advance.
Madam President, we are discussing Kosovo today against the background of a very detailed report by Mr Lagendijk, the rapporteur, which is, of course, linked to statements from the Commission and the Council.
I would like to say that when the result was announced, I was at the other end of Europe, in Sicily.
There the result was received just as you have received it – with applause.
In many other places throughout Europe, people were also delighted with the Irish result.
The Irish have sent a clear signal that they want to continue to be at the heart of a united continent.
I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs for always constructive cooperation.
I would also like to thank the Council and the Commission.
Everyone involved showed a wonderful mixture of political will, professionalism and a willingness to compromise.
Mr President, I would very much like to congratulate the Court of Auditors for the work which it is submitting to Parliament in the form of the Annual Report for 2007.
In a series of constantly improving annual reports, in my opinion this is the best report that the Court of Auditors has so far presented.
It is more informative, more colourful, so to speak, and clearer.
Now I would like to ask the leaders of the political groups for their comments and remarks.
To fund Parliament’s priorities: action to combat climate change, the social dimension in terms of growth for jobs, shaping globalisation and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and also certain lines that improve the safety of citizens.
In total, we have increased payments from 0.89% of gross national income.
The Council, in particular, should keep this at the back of its mind its refusal in particular to instruct independent authorities to investigate such accidents, is totally incomprehensible.
Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are already very much asking ourselves how it can be that we are deciding here about a resolution on a programme that is already out of date?
Yesterday, the Swedish Presidency tabled a new and highly amended proposal for the Stockholm Programme.
I would assume that the vast majority of Members of this esteemed Chamber have not had the opportunity to read the proposal in question.
In my opinion, that is an unacceptable situation for this highly sensitive matter.
Due to the quick adoption of the proposal at first reading, the Commission can now implement its sustainable industrial policy and get straight to work on coming up with other specific steps to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions.
Madam President, the compromise on the emissions trading scheme that is to be voted on tomorrow bears the unmistakeable signature of the European Parliament.
That is what the rapporteur for her part and the shadow rapporteur for his part have both worked for.
This compromise which we reached was also made possible by a high degree of consensus in order to quickly get the programme started again.
That is why, before the Commission tables a Marco Polo III proposal.
We really need a general debate so that we can reintroduce all these points which are necessary to our future orientation. Moreover, we naturally want to know how the adjustment we have made now will work out.
Commissioner, in future who will be the monitor?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to my report, I would like to say once more that we have not conducted ourselves correctly with our decision to debate our own-initiative reports.
When I see how the debates proceed – without dialogue, without controversy, without conflicts – I do not feel this to be a proper parliamentary debate.
I hope we will put that right quickly after the European elections.
I have said something about the grey area, in other words, the surreptitious advertising which you also mentioned.
We are familiar with these practices and our proposals are specifically intended to prevent this surreptitious advertising.
I would also like to say at this point that your personal attitude and your absolute integrity have impressed the whole of this House.
Congratulations!
Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen.
It has now become a tradition that once again no statement of assurance can be issued about the relationship between spending at a European level and administration at a national level.
I can remember discussions with the previous President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, who once said to me that, because of the structures, it was not possible to give a statement of assurance.
For this reason, we should consider how this instrument can be brought to life with the aim of issuing a statement of assurance, if this is justified.
This raises the initial question of whether we really have to have competition between ourselves in Europe when it comes to public money.
The answer is ‘no’! We should change State aid rules.
Relocation subsidies are no longer paid, including by the Member States.
The Bureau of the European Parliament will meet today at 18:30.
We will discuss, step by step and in detail, how we can best ensure that Members can travel from the European Parliament in Strasbourg to their homes.
You will receive an e-mail containing information on this issue tomorrow morning.
If we receive any new information, I will contact you again on Wednesday morning.
The first in-depth information will be sent to you by e-mail before noon tomorrow and you may receive additional information on Wednesday morning.
If we receive any information from the Strasbourg municipal authorities, I will also pass it on to you immediately.
We will continue to monitor the situation in order to ensure that you get home without difficulties.
I would like to remind you that this information is preliminary. We will provide you with further information tomorrow and the following day.
This success is a collective success.
The collective success of those whom no one here sees: all the backroom staff.
It is this Parliament’s success. I should like once again to thank Fiona Hall, Britta Thomsen, Umberto Guidoni, Werner Langen and Anders Wijkman for the trust they placed in my conducting of the negotiations.
I should also like to thank one man in particular, Jean-Louis Borloo.
Without his personal contribution, that of his office and also of the French Presidency.
We should not, for example, have captured Mr Berlusconi for a whole weekend a week ago and brought this directive to a conclusion.
A collective success, therefore, and that is precisely what Europe can achieve!
If we judge all this like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, then you have to say that they want to kill the cow that is supposed to provide the milk.
In the middle of this dilemma, voices are now being raised saying that we finally have to do something to ensure that European companies do not end up in the hands of non-European, for example Chinese, owners. This sell-off of Europe started years ago, with cross-border leasing and other such machinations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas – visas for stays of up to three months – will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area.
This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders.
At the same time, Member States’ responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified.
As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located.
This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world – by far the largest group of travellers to the EU – will benefit.
We can no longer rely on US standards.
The setting of standards in the international financial system, we must create our own new, European options.
We have proposed adopting a whole range of items and ending discussions on them.
This chair would allow us to determine to what extent the blame lies with the Conservatives, driven by exaggerated US neoliberalism.
Take the opportunity to learn from history, so that we can establish a bold European social democracy and not settle for the trivial benefits which the Treaty of Lisbon would allegedly have given us.
I will give you an example from Germany, my home country, of how not to do it.
If the CEO of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, decides to scrap his nine year-old third, fourth or fifth car and buy a new Porsche Cayenne, he will receive EUR 4 000.
Thank you, Mr Queiró.
I use a moped more than a car, but I would like to avoid dying when I am on my moped too, not just when I am in my car.
In some cases, there are airports in two different Member States just a few kilometres from the border between them.
We want to be sure that there is no unfair competition here.
I believe that the new criteria are correct.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President for his generosity and the Commissioner for his positive response.
Can the Commission definitely state that cloning humans, in whatever form, is not and will not be part of this strategy?
The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day.
We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day.
However, we also need to understand that, in China, the violence of the central government which, in this multi-ethnic state with many cultural differences, does not show a sufficient degree of understanding, will always be a recurring problem.
This is why greater cultural autonomy, opportunities relating to the preservation of identity and language are all prerequisites for all the citizens of a multi-ethnic state to be able to live together under one roof.
Continual funding cuts are simply no longer sustainable.
I am aware that there is an erroneous interpretation of the requirements pertaining to type-approval in a number of Member States.
But it is an erroneous interpretation, one which is not in line with the legal framework that is in place. The Commission will ensure that the necessary clarifications are issued and that the negative consequences will not occur.
Building insulation and the use of renewable energy in housing under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) are an initial step in this regard.
We wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights. That is why this is a good arrangement.
We must remember time and time again that, under the European treaties, healthcare in the Member States is a matter for the Member States, and we must respect that.
The organisation and funding of healthcare systems are the responsibility of the Member States, and our legislation can do nothing to change that.
It is not an option, we cannot do it, and we have no intention of doing it unless we were able to agree at some future date to create a common health policy.
That would be the ideal scenario, but I am afraid we are still far from ready to take such a step.
In light of this, the proposals to create a Europe-wide economic stimulus package are just as counterproductive as individual proposals to put up a protective shield over the entire motor industry.
I believe the right course to be to promote research and development into low-pollutant vehicles.
I am also absolutely convinced that we must not alter competition policy overall.
